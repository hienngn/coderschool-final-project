Other studies on topical use of a moisturizer containing a 10% concentration of acetyl hexapeptide-8 have shown it does not penetrate beyond the uppermost layers of skin, even after several hours. That means it cannot affect factors in the underlying layers that lead to the formation of expression lines.  On the other hand, research has shown this peptide can penetrate further into skin if specific formulary steps are followed, including the type of emulsion (a higher water content showed greater penetration). However, even then the peptide wasn’t showing results equivalent to cosmetic corrective procedures.  Still, like all peptides, acetyl hexapeptide-8 has water-binding properties and skin-restoring ability.

ADVANCED GLYCATION ENDPRODUCT (AGE),https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/advanced-glycation-endproduct.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],icky,"Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are destructive substances generated in the body when we consume refined sugars and due to environmental exposure without adequate protection. But first, a bit of backstory… One of the more depressing skincare facts we can think of is how bad dietary sugar or high glycemic index foods (foods that turn to sugar almost immediately after eating them) are for almost every aspect of your skin. Chocolate cake, honey-drenched sweets, ice cream sundaes, bread pudding, and on and on (and we could go on and on) cause very bad things to happen to skin. UV light and air pollutants are attacking your skin from the outside in, and sugar is attacking it from the inside out. What’s the relationship between sugar and AGEs? Sugars quickly and strongly bind to proteins in the skin (proteins are the main building blocks of skin) forming AGEs that progressively and continually destroy many aspects of skin, especially elastin and collagen, the two substances that give skin its firmness and resilience. Once generated, AGEs begin a cascade of progressive damage that isn’t easy to stop or reverse. Research has also shown AGEs can cause abnormal melanin production that leads to the formation of brown spots and mottled skin discolorations. Another ironic acronym for this is RAGEs, meaning a receptor site for AGEs that induces unhealthy melanin production. Although sugar is certainly a major culprit in the skin-damaging creation of AGEs, so is something called the Maillard Reaction (MR). The Maillard Reaction is what happens when you cook any food and brown or blacken it with high heat. That means steaming or sautéing food without browning is far healthier for your skin and body. And chargrilling foods, especially meats, at high heat is even worse! Our apologies to those who prefer their steaks well done. While some skincare companies claim their products contain ingredients that can block AGEs from forming, that benefit hasn’t been supported anywhere in the research. In the meantime, while science is working on this insidious problem, eating a low sugar diet that’s rich in antioxidants, complex carbohydrates, and omega fatty acids is by far the best approach for younger-looking, healthy skin from the inside out (and when you put those ingredients on your skin it can help from the outside in too, it’s just not clear how much that helps control the visible effects of AGEs; however, a huge amount of research shows those ingredients to be beneficial for skin overall). What about the occasional sweet treat? Although we can’t change what eating refined sugars does to your skin (and yes, this includes so-called sugar substitutes like raw honey and agave nectar, both of which the body recognizes as simple sugars), we also realize that sweets play a role in the pleasures of eating and celebrating. The trick is to keep it in moderation, meaning an occasional, judicious indulgence rather than daily consumption of desserts, sugary sodas, and flavored coffee drinks, the latter of which can contain an alarming amount of sugars.

AHA,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/exfoliant/aha.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Exfoliant'],superstar,"Acronym for alpha hydroxy acid. AHAs are derived naturally from various plant sources and from milk, but 99% of the AHAs used in cosmetics are synthetically derived. In low concentrations (less than 3%), AHAs work as water-binding agents. At concentrations greater than 4% and in a base with an acid pH of 3 to 4, these ingredients can exfoliate by breaking down the substance that holds dead skin together. The most effective and well-researched AHAs are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be effective. AHAs may sensitize mucous membranes. However, AHAs have been widely used for improving signs of aging, dry skin and an uneven skin tone, all of which lead to younger-looking skin. There is a vast amount of research that substantially describes how the aging process affects skin and that demonstrates that many of the unwanted changes can be improved by topical application of AHAs, including glycolic and lactic acids. AHA use can result in increased sensitivity to the sun, though wearing a sunscreen daily eliminates this risk. Note: AHAs are of little benefit when added to rinse-off products, as their contact with skin is too brief for them to function as exfoliants or absorb into skin.

ALCOHOL,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/emollients/alcohol.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,"['Emollients', 'Cleansing Agents']",average,"""Alcohol"" refers to a group of organic compounds with a vast range of forms and uses in cosmetics and in other types of products and solutions.  For skin, there are good alcohols and bad alcohols, corresponding to high-molecular-weight alcohols and low-molecular-weight alcohols, respectively, which can have emollient properties (cetyl alcohol) or act as detergent cleansing agents like isopropanol.  There also are benign forms, including glycols, which are used as humectants to help hydrate and deliver ingredients into skin’s uppermost layers. Alcohols with low molecular weights—the bad-for-skin kind—can be drying and sensitizing. The alcohols to be concerned about in skincare products are ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol. The concern is when one or more of these are listed among the main ingredients; tiny amounts in an otherwise good formula aren’t a problem. In addition to being drying and sensitizing, these alcohols can disrupt skin’s surface layers. Alcohol helps ingredients like retinol and vitamin C penetrate into the skin more effectively, but it does that by breaking down the surface layers of skin—destroying the very substances that keep your skin feeling healthier and looking younger over the long term. Alcohols like SD and ""denatured"" immediately harm the skin, starting a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. A 2003 study published found that with regular exposure to alcohol-based products, cleansing becomes a damaging ordeal—skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding its surface layers. It also destroyed the substances in skin that help to naturally soothe and defend it against visible effects of environmental damage. If that weren’t bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes healthy substances in skin to literally self-destruct. The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin’s substances increased the longer the exposure to alcohol; that is, two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day, and that is only from exposure to a 3% concentration (most skincare products with denatured alcohol contain greater amounts than that). In short, for the healthy appearance of skin at any age, avoiding products that contain high amounts of the drying, sensitizing types of alcohol is a non-negotiable skincare must.

ALUMINUM,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/aluminum.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Uncategorized'],goodie,"Aluminum is the most common element on Earth. It's also a common source of confusion in terms of its presence in cosmetics, specifically whether that presence poses a health risk. The fact is, when you read ""aluminum"" on an ingredient list, it isn't pure aluminum—not even close.
Pure aluminum is not added to any skincare or makeup product. Rather, compounds (mixtures of aluminum), such as aluminum combined with other natural elements, are safety used in a variety of ways in personal care products, foods and medicines. These compounds contain only traces of aluminum, and in daily use over the long term are perfectly safe. Such ingredients actually contain less aluminum than what occurs naturally in plants, vegetables or even in the human body).
Here are a few examples of the most common aluminum compounds used as ingredients in cosmetics, and a brief description of what they are (as well as their global safety status).

aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride contain only trace quantities of pure aluminum. These are most commonly used in antiperspirant and deodorants (and some medications) with extensive safety records.
alumina is also not ""aluminum,"" but rather a combination of minerals that contain various mixtures of aluminum, silica, chloride or zirconium and oxygen. It is also known as ""aluminum oxide"" or ""aluminum hydroxide,"" and is used safely in cosmetics, medicines and medical devices.
magnesium aluminum silicate is refined from clay and often used as an absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It is unable to penetrate skin.
aluminum starch is made from a reaction of a plant-derived ingredient (starch), and often used as a thickening or absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It has an extensive safety record.

 In cosmetics, the minute quantities of aluminum present in such ingredients are not at risk of absorption, as it these ingredients are insoluble—they are physically incapable of absorption into the body. This is true of such ingredients, whether they are used in cosmetics or skincare/personal care products.
In fact, skin does not readily absorb cosmetic ingredients. It's actually quite challenging to penetrate the skin's outer layers with skincare or medical products—such formulas must be specifically engineered to allow ingredients to penetrate even the most superficial layer of skin.
Thus, aluminum or aluminum ingredients do not contribute to health risks, and a link otherwise has not been established. Quite the opposite, as the Mayo Clinic, The World Health Organization, the European Union and the FDA have all concurred that there is no linkage of aluminum in personal care products to other health risks.
Published literature and an overwhelming amount of research has shown that skin cannot absorb aluminum from these ingredients, and what is used is far less than what we are exposed to daily in the food and water (given aluminum is a natural element that's present all around us—whether we use products with aluminum ingredients or not).",2

It is a potent antioxidant and skin-soothing agent that can improve the appearance of signs of aging.Ascorbic acid is also a powerhouse when mixed with other antioxidants, or when used alone in higher concentrations, such as 15% or 20% or greater, amounts that can be great for evening out skin tone.A particularly vulnerable antioxidant when exposed to UV light and air, ascorbic acid must be packaged to protect it from these elements during routine use, or its effectiveness will gradually become diminished to the point of not working at all (you will see this as oxidized discoloration, meaning the product turns a copper to brownish color). For this reason, avoid any vitamin C (ascorbic acid) products packaged in jars.What about using vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and niacinamide in the same product or applied at the same time in separate products? You might have read or heard that niacinamide and vitamin C shouldn’t be used at the same time, whether found together in the same product or applied separately one after the other. Rest assured, this combination is fine and is in fact quite beneficial! The research this misconception is based on was conducted in the 1960s; the forms of niacinamide and vitamin C used in this study were not stabilized—although niacinamide itself is very stable. The base of the formula used in this study was also far different than today’s sophisticated skincare formulas.  Today, cosmetic chemists know how to combine niacinamide and vitamin C in the ideal base formulas that enhance their compatibility. The other common concern we’ve seen about combining these two ingredients has to do with the pH range. The concern is that the acidic environment ascorbic acid needs to be most effective will cause niacinamide will convert to nicotinic acid, a form that can be sensitizing, possibly inducing redness. Good news: This conversion process would only happen under conditions of the formula being exposed to very high heat for a long period of time. This would not apply to layering skincare products or to heat conditions that occur during manufacturing, transport, and storage of cosmetic products that contain niacinamide and ascorbic acid.  What all of this means is that you can use or layer products containing both niacinamide and vitamin C knowing that they will not render each other any less effective. Each of these ingredients on its own can help to address dark spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dullness. When used together, they become even more of a powerhouse! This duo will help give you an even better chance at achieving a radiant, smooth, even, younger-looking complexion.References for this information:Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, January 2012, issue 1, pages 51-56AAPS PharmSciTech, September 2011, issue 3, pages 917-923Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, September 2008, issue 3, pages 418-425Dermatologic Surgery, July 2005, issue 7, part 2, pages 814-817Dermatologic Surgery, February 2001, issue 2, pages 137-142",3

Antioxidants (such as vitamin E and ubiquinone) also show promise for enhancing avobenzone’s photostability.This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.

Azelaic acid is also an antioxidant. Research has shown azelaic acid can significantly diminish blemishes, help fade the appearance of post-acne red marks and other discolorations, and reduce the kind of skin sensitivity that leads to redness. Although azelaic acid can be derived from grains like barley, wheat, and rye, its lab-engineered form is typically used in skincare products because of its stability and effectiveness. Because of this, azelaic acid is considered a synthetic ingredient, but this is a clear case where the synthetic version outperforms the natural version, with no research indicating a risk to skin. Azelaic acid is available in strengths of 10% or less over-the-counter, and in topical prescription products at concentrations between 15-20%.

This plant, also known as babchi, is native to and grows throughout India, where it plays a role in Ayurvedic medicine, and is also found in China (where it’s used in Chinese natural medicine) as well as parts of Africa. Ongoing in vitro (Petri dish) and in vivo (on skin) research has shown that bakuchiol seems to have skin-restoring ability when applied twice daily, and that it may also have a brightening effect on skin. Research has also shown this plant ingredient has soothing and anti-wrinkle properties as well as helping to visibly improve skin color and tone. Bakuchiol is often touted as an alternative to retinol minus the sensitizing effects some people experience from retinol. The association between bakuchiol and retinol is because many of its benefits seem to mimic what retinol does; however, it’s important to distinguish that bakuchiol is not identical to retinol. It’s not an equivalent replacement any more than a blueberry is the nutritional equivalent of an apple. Science has revealed that bakuchiol interacts with many of the same areas in skin as retinol, sometimes by taking the same pathway, other times by going a different route but still leading to the same results, such as diminished wrinkles, improved elasticity, and smoother skin. In either case, we’re confident that bakuchiol is a promising, beneficial ingredients whose actions can complement and enhance what retinol does for skin. Research has confirmed that bakuchiol works best in concentrations between 0.5-2%. Amounts lower than that have not been shown to provide retinol-like benefits.

As a cosmetic ingredient, the synthetic form is used so as to avoid sulfuric acid impurities that can irritate skin. It works to opacify products, such as creams and lotions but is used extensively in non-aqueous makeup products such as lipsticks, blush, and mascaras, as it helps extend the longevity of cosmetic pigments, plus apply its own “coloration” similar to how titanium dioxide adds whiteness. Barium sulfate may play a role in skin barrier recovery by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board revisited the safety of barium sulfate as used in cosmetics, where amounts range from 0.99%-37% in either rinse-off or leave-on products. The Board determined barium sulfate is safe and non-sensitizing provided it’s formulated to be non-irritating (meaning the finished ingredient does not contain irritating salts from sulfuric acid). As the synthetic form of barium sulfate is what’s available for use in cosmetics, there is, quite literally, no need to be concerned that it might irritate skin; however, as with any cosmetic ingredient, an individual allergic reaction could still occur (although this is considered rare).

Although betaine salicylate appears to be promising, there’s no independent research to go on, and no independent studies comparing its effectiveness to the well-established BHA ingredient salicylic acid.The only research about betaine salicylate comes from Arch Personal Care Products, an ingredient manufacturer that sells this ingredient. According to their information based on in vivo testing, betaine salicylate shows comparable effectiveness to salicylic acid at double the concentration. So, in seems that in order to get the same results from betaine salicylate as a product with 2% salicylic acid, a 4% concentration of betaine salicylate is necessary.Interestingly, like salicylic acid, betaine salicylate’s effectiveness is pH-dependent, with a pH range of 3.8-4.2 being needed.Anecdotal information from consumers who’ve tried products with betaine salicylate and salicylic acid is mixed; some people report better results and tolerability with betaine salicylate, while others report that salicylic acid worked better, without any unwanted effects. Our advice? Unless you know your skin cannot tolerate or doesn’t respond well to leave-on exfoliants with salicylic acid, there’s little reason to seek out an exfoliant with betaine salicylate.

Some cosmetic companies claim that bismuth oxychloride is natural and better for skin than talc. The truth is that in many ways talc is a more natural, unadulterated, pure ingredient than bismuth oxychloride. Bismuth oxychloride, which seldom occurs in nature, is manufactured by combining bismuth, a by-product of lead and copper metal refining, with chloride (a chlorine compound) and water. It's used in cosmetics because it has a distinct shimmery, pearlescent appearance and a fine white powder texture that adheres well to skin. Bismuth oxychloride is heavier than talc. Pure bismuth is a naturally occurring, grayish-white powder. It and its derivatives are used as skin protectives, thickeners, and absorbent agents. Bismuth oxychloride was permanently listed by the FDA as a coloring agent in 1977 and for use as a synthetic ingredient.Some people react to bismuth oxychloride due to its unique crystalline structure. What happens is that the crystals can ""poke"" at skin and get stuck in the pores, where the sharper ""spokes"" can cause irritation. This is more of a problem when bismuth oxychloride is the main ingredient in powder makeup.Pure concentrations of bismuth oxychloride nanoparticles appear to have a negative effect on human skin cells.

The new labeling will also tell consumers on the back of the product that sunscreens labeled as both “Broad Spectrum” and “SPF 15” (or higher) not only protect against sunburn, but, if used as directed with other sun protection measures, can reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. For these broad spectrum products, higher SPF (Sun Protection Factor) values also indicate higher levels of overall protection. By contrast, any sunscreen not labeled as “Broad Spectrum” or that has an SPF value between 2 and 14, has only been shown to help prevent sunburn.

The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

It’s often included in skincare products with claims that it will improve the look of cellulite or puffy eyes. Unfortunately, research into caffeine’s effects in this regard are mixed. Caffeine’s popularity in products related to cellulite is due to its distant relationship to aminophylline (an ingredient once thought to improve the look of cellulite), which is a modified form of theophylline, and caffeine contains theophylline.Applied to skin, caffeine may have soothing and antioxidant properties, especially when skin is exposed to UV light. It can penetrate skin and has a constricting effect, which can help improve the look of redness but also may be sensitizing.When it comes to puffy eyes, there is no research indicating caffeine can have any benefit; in fact, research has shown caffeine has an inhibitory action on a key protein in skin that helps it look younger.

Specific to anti-pollution, testing on human skin samples revealed that topical application of the flower extract protects fibroblasts (cells in skin that make collagen) from oxidative damage that heavy metal airborne pollutants trigger. It also intercepts collagen-degrading enzymes before they lead to visible signs of aging such as wrinkles and orange peel-like skin texture. At the same time, this plant extract addresses loss of collagen that can visibly impact pore size. Along with offering antioxidant and pollution-neutralizing benefits on its own, topical application of Camellia japonica flower also boosts the presence of several antioxidant enzymes that naturally occur in skin, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. This helps skin better defend itself against external aggressors that detract from a healthy appearance. This plant is also a rich source of the oil-soluble antioxidant gallic acid that defends skin against visible signs of UVB damage while also interrupting excess melanin production.

Although listed on a cosmetic product by the approved name of cannabidiol, this ingredient is commonly referred to as CBD. Cannabidiol is one of numerous cannabinoids found primarily in the Cannabis species of plants. It occurs naturally in the flowering tops of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa) but not in hemp seeds. Products that contain hemp seed oil that tout it as the source of cannabidiol most likely do not contain this substance (especially if you don’t see it listed among the product’s ingredients); however, it is possible to grow CBD-enriched hemp, where meaningful amounts of the cannabidiol is found in multiple parts of the plant. Confusing? Absolutely, which is why it’s important to only purchase CBD skin care from a trusted brand. Cannabidiol has been shown to offer numerous benefits related to calming skin. Skin has specific receptor sites for cannabinoids (referred to as its endocannabinoid system). It seems CBD can “talk” to these receptor sites on skin, sending unique signals to stop firing the wrong messages, which in turn leads to healthier, better-looking skin. This benefit makes cannabidiol an intriguing ingredient for interrupting the progression of damage within skin’s uppermost layers that can lead to visible problems; however, more research needs to be done to gain a greater understanding of how CBD works on skin. Research has also shown, though isn’t entirely clear on how this works, that CBD seems to visibly reduce oily skin. It’s also a very good antioxidant, on par with vitamins C and E. A quick note on the other compound in Cannabis that’s often mentioned, and that’s THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). This is the cannabinoid in marijuana (Cannabis indica) that has psychoactive effects (gets you high). The cannabidiol in skin care products must be THC-free, which means it contains 0.3% or less of this chemical, an amount lawmakers have deemed safe and unable to produce any sort of “high.” Last, the legal status of CBD in skin care (meaning for topical use only, not ingestion) appears to be on solid footing for now, but it’s a changing landscape that is being examined with an aim on clarifying its usage for consumers.

In vitro studies have shown LHA tends to stay within the stratum corneum (the outermost layers of skin), while salicylic acid penetrates up to 58% further. This limitation may explain why capryloyl salicylic acid is not considered as effective for acne as salicylic acid. Speaking of acne, there is comparative research showing capryloyl salicylic acid used with benzoyl peroxide and/or a topical antibiotic produced slightly better results than using benzoyl peroxide and the topical antibiotic alone. While that’s encouraging, if you’re struggling with acne, regular salicylic acid should remain your go-to exfoliant. Just like salicylic acid, the capryloyl derivative has exfoliating and soothing properties as well as documented improvement in skin tone, wrinkles, and clogged pores. It also has the same formulary requirements around the pH range it works best, although unlike salicylic acid, in skin care LHA’s concentration is typically no greater than 1%. Interestingly, comparative research hasn’t focused on salicylic acid; instead, the single study that exists compared capryloyl salicylic acid to the alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) glycolic acid. In such instances, lower amounts (5-10%) of capryloyl salicylic acid were shown to produce an equivalent to superior level of visible improvement compared with much greater (20-50%) concentrations of glycolic acid. Due to the natural calming properties salicylic acid has, it wasn’t surprising that the LHA peels were perceived as less irritating than the AHA peel. Capryloyl salicylic acid is generally considered safe when used as directed. Note: Although studies on this ingredient were generally well done and followed scientific principles, it’s worth noting that all of them were either done by, funded by, or otherwise supported by L’Oreal. This does not mean the results cannot be counted on, only that there was incentive to cast this ingredient in its best light.

Ceramides are necessary for their water-retention capacity and adding them to a skincare product helps provide replenishing and restoring benefits. Nine different ceramides have been identified in skin, some of which are used in skincare products. On a skincare product ingredient label, you’ll see those listed as ceramide AP, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide NS, phytosphingosine, and sphingosine.  The ceramides used in skincare products typically are derived from plants (wheat germ is a common source) or are synthetic; there’s no research showing that either form is preferred over the other. Ceramides work best for skin when they’re combined with other replenishing ingredients like fatty acids and cholesterol.

The root portion of this plant contains numerous compounds that have been shown to calm skin and visibly reduce redness from external irritants. All parts of the plant can increase the presence of the body’s “master antioxidant”, glutathione, as well as act as an antioxidant itself. The flower extract from butterfly pea has been shown in studies to also have anti-glycation properties.

Due to its antioxidant activity, cucumber is a welcome addition to anti-aging products.
Cucumber contains fragrant components that are not sensitizing to skin (a rarity) so it can be used to enhance the natural scent of a cosmetic product without issue.
While this ingredient is often reported to be useful for improving the appearance of puffy eyes there is not adequate, reliable research to support this contention.
In case you’re wondering: The act of placing slightly chilled cucumber slices over the eye may help reduce puffiness, but that’s not because the cucumber has de-puffing properties. Rather, it’s the coolness of it that diminishes puffiness and constricts the skin, and cucumber slices just happen to fit the contours of the eye area.

Diazolidinyl urea can be a formaldehyde-releasing preservative. Although that sounds scary, the amount of formaldehyde released is well below the recommended limits of exposure. Moreover, other ingredients (such as proteins) in a product cause the free formaldehyde to evaporate and become inactive before it could possibly harm skin.

DIBUTYL PHTHALATE,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/dibutyl-phthalate.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Uncategorized'],average,"Also known as DBP, it is a common ingredient in nail polish and most synthetic fragrances sold today. It is used as a plasticizer, fragrance stabilizer, and is a key component in giving nail polish its unique properties. The most common mode of exposure, though, is through foods that come into contact with PVC (polyvinylchloride) plastic packaging. Phthalates are also found in countless other products, including building materials, insecticides, nutritional supplements, children’s toys, and automobiles (Source: International Journal of Andrology, February 2006, pages 181–185). In short, it is impossible to completely avoid exposure to phthalates.
Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) became controversial when The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals—Results for Mono-butyl phthalate [which is] (metabolized from dibutyl phthalate). The report noted that measurable levels of phthalate were found in the urine of the participants in the study. However, the CDC also stated that “Finding a measurable amount of one or more phthalate metabolites in urine does not mean that the level of one or more phthalates causes an adverse health effect. Whether phthalates at the levels of metabolites reported here are a cause for health concern is not yet known; more research is needed.""
Despite the negative association phthalate exposure has in animals, an analysis of multiple studies and epidemiologic research led to the conclusion that “...the risks are low, even lower than originally thought, and that there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects on humans. Since the scientific evidence strongly suggests that risks to humans are low, phthalate regulations that have been enacted are unlikely to lead to any marked improvement in public health.”

DMAE,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/skin-restoring/dmae.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Skin-Restoring'],average,"DMAE, also known as dimethyl MEA, is a derivative of the B vitamin choline. It has been around for years as an oral supplement that's popularly believed to improve mental alertness, much like Ginkgo biloba and coenzyme Q10. However, the research about DMAE does not show the same positive results as the other two supplements. 
Because DMAE is chemically similar to choline, DMAE is thought to stimulate production of acetylcholine. And because acetylcholine is a brain neurotransmitter, it's easy to see how it could be associated with brain function. However, only a handful of studies have looked at DMAE for that purpose and they have not been conclusive in the least, while some have shown that DMAE may be problematic or not very effective.
It’s a controversial ingredient for skin because research has shown conflicting results. It seems to offer an initial benefit that improves skin firmness, but these results are short-lived and eventually give way to destruction of the substances in skin that help keep it firm. DMAE may also have skin-calming effects.
Interestingly, there is a formulation challenge when including DMAE in skincare products. To maintain the efficacy and stability of DMAE, the product’s pH level must be at least 10. A pH of 10 is highly alkaline, which isn’t good news for skin. 
Moreover, because almost all moisturizers (including serums and eye creams) are formulated with a pH that closely matches that of human skin (generally 5.5–6.5, which is on the acidic side of the scale), in all likelihood the DMAE included in skincare products cannot have any prolonged functionality.

In doing so, skin can better maintain a smooth, soft surface.

As a result there is research from that part of the world showing it to be a good emollient that can help restore skin. But along with the evidence that emu oil is a good emollient and the parade of companies promoting it for that, there are also companies promoting products containing emu oil for its antiaging properties.

So does emu oil live up to these acclaimed properties? Regrettably, none of these promises are supported by research. A study looked at the ""Cosmetic and moisturizing properties of Emu oil... assessed in a double-blind clinical study. Emu oil in comparison to mineral oil was found overall to be more cosmetically acceptable and had better skin penetration/permeability.""
Like many ingredients, it has soothing, emollient properties, but it isn’t the miracle marketers make it out to be. Emu oil's reputation is driven mostly by claims made by companies selling products that contain it, and not by any real proof that it is an essential requirement for skin.

ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/environmental-damage.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],icky,"Occurrence that takes place at an atomic level and is a complex physiological process. Molecules are comprised of atoms. Atoms comprise all matter. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons occur in pairs, and when an element only has a few paired electrons it can easily become unstable.
Oxygen and oxides are primary examples of potential unstable elements in our environment. When oxygen interacts with skin (and because the air we breathe is 20% oxygen, that happens all the time), it almost always loses one of its electrons. This oxygen molecule, which now is minus one electron, is a damaging environmental factor.
Because it is now unstable, the oxygen molecule quickly finds another electron, and it does this by taking an electron from another molecule in the skin, which is usually a healthy substance such as antioxidants in the skin. Antioxidants have lots of electrons to spare. Once those substances are robbed of all their electrons they break down and are destroyed. Oxygen molecules (or other potentially damaging environmental factors) attempting to replenish themselves in this way trigger a cascading event. The reactions that cause environmental damage take place in mere fractions of a second. Antioxidants are substances that prevent oxidative damage from beginning.

The primary causes of environmental damage on skin are pollution, air, cigarette smoke, herbicides, and solvents (such as alcohol). Antioxidants are a way to potentially neutralize these effects via topical application.",0

Sometimes several enzymes are required to carry out a particular  reaction, and their actions are affected by temperature and pH. Some enzymes depend on the presence of other enzymes, called coenzymes, to function, or they depend on a specific body temperature. It would require an exceptionally complicated process to stimulate enzyme activity via topical application to skin.

ETHYLPARABEN,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/ethylparaben.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],goodie,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

When an FD&C color is followed by the word “lake,” it means the color has been mixed with a mineral (most commonly calcium or aluminum) to make the color insoluble (not affected by water). For example, “FD&C Blue No. 1–Aluminum Lake” means that the color FD&C Blue No. 1 has been combined with aluminum. Lake colors are used for candies and for dyes used to color Easter eggs, among countless cosmetics applications.
The current group of FD&C colors has been extensively studied, with many classified as “permanently approved” for use in drugs and foods. Some FD&C colors, such as Blue 1 and Blue 2, are derivatives of coal tar and can cause allergic reactions, although the amounts used in items such as lipsticks typically are lower than the amounts used for other types of coloring agents. No coal tar colors are permitted in products for use around the eyes, and every batch of coal tar color must be deemed safe before it can be used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics.
Any coloring agent used in eye makeup must be specifically approved for that purpose by the FDA.
The color of cosmetics products is often an emotional pull for many consumers. A soft pink lotion can denote a moisturizer meant to calm or soothe skin, while a bright yellow balm may be deemed energizing. Whether natural or synthetic, coloring agents in skincare products serve no purpose other than to create a perception or an emotional response to the product. Coloring agents used in makeup are a different story, as they’re used to create an endless kaleidoscope of shades.

It’s a rich source of a class of antioxidants known as phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, various epicatechins, and anthocyanins which contribute to the rich, often dark color of fig skin and the fruit inside. Along with being an antioxidant, fig has been shown to enhance skin’s hydration by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. It can also visibly improve skin color by addressing an enzyme in skin (tyrosinase) whose overproduction can lead to dark spots. Those benefits are intriguing, but there’s more: fig extract has also been to help reduce uncomfortably dry, tight skin, including compromised, redness-prone skin. One caution: Fig contains a group of naturally-occurring compounds known as psoralens. These can make skin more sensitive to sun exposure, but you can get around this by using a broad spectrum sunscreen every day. The leaves, root and sap from the fig plant contain the highest concentration of psoralens, which is why the fruit portion, which contains appreciably low levels, is typically used in skin care.

Also known as Reishi mushroom, when applied to skin, research has shown a compound it contains (ganodermanondiol) can interrupt the enzyme tyrosinase, which in turn can visibly reduce certain types of discoloration. Research has also shown this extract can improve skin’s supportive elements while also reducing signs of irritation. It’s a natural source of vitamin D2, skin-beneficial trace minerals such as copper and selenium, and the amino acids leucine and lysine. As with most other types of mushrooms, Ganoderma lucidum is also a very good antioxidant. The extract form of this mushroom eliminates the water component (the whole mushroom that you’d buy in the grocery store contains over 90% water), so only a small amount is needed to get its benefits.

Research has shown that oral consumption of glucosylceramides, whether from wheat, corn, rice bran, beets, or konjac root can make it from the digestion process to skin. Interestingly (but not too surprising) research has also shown that glucosylceramides have less benefit for normal skin than they do for dry, sun-damaged, or otherwise compromised skin. Plant-derived glucosylceramides can visibly repair and strengthen skin’s barrier, improve hydration channels in skin, and interrupt factors in skin that trigger signs of sensitivity, dryness, and dullness.

GLUTEN INGREDIENTS,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/gluten-ingredients.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],goodie,"Gluten is a protein that occurs naturally in many types of grains, including wheat, rye, and barley. As a general group, gluten ingredients include several grains or grain-derived ingredients that are potentially problematic for those diagnosed with a health condition that interferes with the normal digestion of glutens. In this instance, eating gluten-containing foods is ill-advised.
The question is whether those with such a health condition or dietary sensitivity should avoid gluten ingredients in cosmetics, and the answer is no. That’s because gluten ingredients cannot get past the skin’s uppermost layers and enter the body (specifically, the digestive system) where they can be troublesome for those with a gluten intolerance. Gluten is simply too big to get into the body via topical application. 
The exception is applying gluten-containing products to lips, as in these instances some amount of ingestion occurs. Therefore, you’d want to avoid lip balm, gloss, or lipstick/lip color products that contain gluten ingredients.
Of course, if you have an allergy to gluten ingredients you’d want to check with your health care provider to determine if the allergy is limited to oral consumption or also includes topical application (assuming you haven’t already determined that topical application of gluten ingredients is a problem for you).
If you have a known sensitivity to gluten, avoid products that contain wheat and its derivatives, malt, barley, rye, wheat germ, and oat ingredients.

It can be derived from natural substances by hydrolysis of fats and by fermentation of sugars; it also can be synthetically manufactured, which is usually the case with modern-day skincare products.Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and skin-restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration. It’s one of the many substances in skin that helps maintain a healthy look and feel, defending against dryness and working to maintain skin’s moisture level. Essentially, glycerin is a master at hydration, and works best when combined with other replenishing and emollient ingredients.Some people wonder whether using products with glycerin takes too much water from skin when there isn’t enough humidity in the air. This can occur with pure glycerin (100% concentration—an amount that’s never used in skincare products). Any humectant (including glycerin) used in pure form can increase water loss by attracting water from the lower layers of skin into the surface layers when the climate is too arid (low humidity). For this reason, glycerin and humectants are typically used in concentrations of 5% or less and always combined with other ingredients to soften skin. In fact, glycerin combined with other emollients and/or oils is a fundamental cornerstone of most moisturizers.

Claims of gold helping to create electric charges in skin to trigger improvement in signs of aging are completely unproven.
Another form of gold used in skincare products is “colloidal gold,” which means that the gold particles have been nanosized (usually to 1–15 nanometers) so that it remains dispersed evenly throughout a solution. Although gold is a heavy metal, and heavy metals are subject to regulations, colloidal gold preparations are not regulated, so the risks are unknown. Initial research shows that it is fairly safe.
Colloidal gold also is used in the world of medicine, where there is a minor amount of research that it might have benefit because of assumed skin-soothing properties. Most of that research, however, is either very old or was performed on only a very small group of people, not enough to prove efficacy.
Even if gold were a good skin-soothing agent, its effects have never been compared with the effects of the numerous potent and stable skin-soothing ingredients that are commonly used in skincare products and that have a great deal of research proving their benefit and safety. What is for certain: There is no published research proving that gold, normal or colloidal in size, has any anti-aging benefits.

Sunflower oil is particularly beneficial for dry, dehydrated, or environmentally compromised skin because its linoleic acid content helps skin synthesize its own lipids (fats), including ceramides, visibly repairing its barrier and leading to smoother, healthier-looking skin. Sunflower seed oil also has a natural calming effect on skin, so can be helpful for reducing signs of skin stress or irritation.

Because both hemp and marijuana are from the genus Cannabis, they are often thought (erroneously) to have similar properties. In cosmetics, hemp seed oil is used as an emollient and to supply skin with omega fatty acids it needs to replenish itself and strengthen its surface against moisture loss. Specifically, hemp seed oil contains the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Hemp seed oil also contains beneficial phospholipids, plant sterols, amino acids (it’s especially high in the amino acid arginine) and is a rich source of antioxidant vitamin E. Another benefit of hemp seed oil is that it seems to enhance the benefits of cannabidiol, also known as CBD. This is likely due to the interaction between trace amounts of cannabinoids in hemp seed oil and pure cannabidiol.

This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk.

This is due to its amino acid, peptide, antioxidant, antibacterial composition. The primary research on honey and skin has to do with its multi-faceted role in soothing various concerns. Dark honeys have a stronger antioxidant effect than light honeys. Regular honey is also known as clarified honey or purified honey. Honey’s primary use in skincare products is related to its potent antioxidant properties; however, it’s role in helping wounds heal has been shown to have some benefits in comparison to traditional medicines and procedures. Honey forms a barrier on skin that can help soothe and protect. Manuka is a type of honey that shows up in many skincare products. Often hyped as a special kind of honey, it’s produced in New Zealand from bees that pollinate the country’s native Manuka shrub. Manuka honey is similar to “regular” clover honey except it’s said to contain more of a chemical called methylglyoxal, which might give manuka honey an advantage. Some research shows that it doesn’t necessarily have an edge over other varieties for calming properties and wound healing such as acacia and buckwheat honey.

If you’re struggling with brown spots or skin discolorations, hydroquinone remains among the best ingredients to treat them.A reminder that no ingredient will work to fade brown spots if you’re not diligent about daily application of a broad spectrum sunscreen. Unprotected sun exposure is the root cause of most dark spots, so forgoing sunscreen means you won’t see the results you want, no matter how well formulated the product may be.References for this information:The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, August 2014, pages 13-17Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, March 2013, pages S32-S37The Journal of Dermatological Treatment, September 2010, pages 272-275Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, November 2007, pages 854-872Dermatologic Therapy, September-October 2007, pages 308-313Critical Reviews in Toxicology, October 2007, pages 887-914; and May 1999, pages 283-330Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, August 2006, pages 781-787Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, June 1998, pages 301-317",3

This is advantageous because it allows cosmetic chemists to use a lower amount of preservatives (such as phenoxyethanol) without losing efficacy but with the benefit of reducing the risk of an allergic reaction. Hydroxyacetophenone also has soothing ability because it can inhibit an enzyme (known as COX-2) in skin’s surface that can lead to signs of irritation.

Other published studies compared the red grape antioxidant compound reseveratrol and L-ergothioneine to idebenone and found both superior to idebenone 

To date, there are still no published, peer-reviewed studies that support idebenone’s alleged superiority. This does not mean idebenone is not a valid antioxidant for skin.

All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

Note that jojoba wax is considered more of an issue for breakout-prone skin than jojoba oil.Jojoba oil has the distinction of feeling lighter and less greasy than many other oils, particularly highly saturated oils such as coconut. Jojoba oil is also one of the more stable plant oils in use today. References for this information: Energy Conversion and Management, December 2016, pages 293-304Journal of Italian Dermatology and Venereology, December 2013, pages 687-691Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, December 2008, pages 268-274Journal of Dermatological Science, May 2008, pages 135-142Pharmacological Research, February 2005, pages 95-105",3

Kojic acid’s downside is that it’s an extremely unstable ingredient in cosmetic formulations. On exposure to air or sunlight, it turns brown and loses its efficacy. Many cosmetics companies use kojic dipalmitate as an alternative because it’s more stable in formulations. However, there’s no research showing that kojic dipalmitate is as effective as kojic acid, although it’s a good antioxidant.

Lanolin has long been burdened with a reputation for being a sensitizing agent, which has always been a disappointment to formulators because lanolin is such an effective moisturizing ingredient. 
A study in the British Journal of Dermatology concluded “that lanolin sensitization has remained at a relatively low and constant rate even in a high-risk population.” Based on a review of 24,449 patients who were tested with varying forms of lanolin, it turned out that “The mean annual rate of sensitivity was 1.7%”—and it was lower than that for a 50% concentration of lanolin. The amounts of lanolin used in products like facial and body moisturizers are much less than this, so the risk, if any, is negligible. 
Lanolin is a very good ingredient for someone with dry skin, though it can be a problem for someone with oily or breakout-prone skin. Also, as an animal-derived ingredient, lanolin is sometimes viewed as less favorable in comparison to synthetic or plant-derived alternatives.

Lemon, whether in juice or oil form, is a must to avoid in cosmetics.

Lemon juice applied to skin can cause photosensitivity, which is due to a volatile fragrance chemical known as limonene, which is abundant in lemon juice. Bottom line: There's no research showing that lemon juice has a positive effect on brightening an uneven skin tone, yet it's clear this ingredient is a potent skin sensitizer.

Lemon oil contains numerous fragrance chemicals that can cause a reaction when on skin that’s subsequently exposed to sunlight. Examples of the fragrance chemicals in lemon oil include limonene, bergapten, and oxypeucedanin. Although it smells great, fragrance is not skincare! The major fragrance chemical in lemon oil is limonene.

It functions as an emollient and softening agent in skin care and hair care products. This plant oil is exceedingly stable because it is primarily composed of long chain fatty acids, the type most resistant to rancidity when exposed to oxygen. Among plant oils, meadowfoam has the highest concentration (95%) of these highly stable fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to products that would otherwise be prone to spoiling quickly. Meadowfoam seed oil contains two compounds known as glucosinolate derivatives, 3-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate (MBITC) and 3-methoxyphenyl acetonitrile. Research has shown these compounds can inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure (but just to be clear, these ingredients do not replace the need for broad spectrum sunscreen). The glucosinolate derivatives are not direct antioxidants (indeed, meadowfoam seed oil isn’t a good source of antioxidants), but they can positively influence skin’s own antioxidant defenses, which is a nice benefit. Meadowfoam seed oil can also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into soil and across animal skin; however, to date the same benefit hasn’t been shown to occur on human skin. On the upside, the long-chain fatty acids in this plant oil have chemical similarity to some of the fatty acids found in skin’s own oil, so in theory it’s certainly possible meadowfoam oil would help deliver other oil-based (lipophilic) ingredients to skin.

Moving away from fatty acid content, white lupine oil is also high in protein and a good source of the hydrating amino acid lysine. Note that the seed oil from this plants comes in bitter and sweet varieties; the bitter form contains a much higher amount of substances known as alkaloids, which are potential skin sensitizers. The sweet form, which is what Paula’s Choice uses, only contains trace levels of these problematic compounds, too low to upset skin.

Unlike glycolic acid, mandelic acid is light-sensitive and must be packaged in an opaque container to remain effective. A couple studies have shown that mandelic acid and salicylic acid worked well together in a higher-strength peel for use on darker skin tones struggling with discolorations, including post-acne marks. However, what we don’t know is how well mandelic acid would’ve worked on its own—it’s possible the results were more from salicylic acid than the combination of the two acids.

METHYLPARABEN,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/methylparaben.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],goodie,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

Among these benefits is the ability to visibly improve the appearance of enlarged pores, uneven skin tone, fine lines, dullness, and a weakened skin surface. Niacinamide can also mitigate and to some extent help visibly repair damage from UV light and offset other sources of environmental attack, including the negative impact of various types of airborne pollutants. Unlike many beneficial ingredients, niacinamide is stable in the presence of heat and light. What about using vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and niacinamide in the same product or applied at the same time in separate products?  You might have read or heard that niacinamide and vitamin C shouldn’t be used at the same time, whether found together in the same product or applied separately one after the other. Rest assured, this combination is fine and is in fact quite beneficial!  The research this misconception is based on was conducted in the 1960s; the forms of niacinamide and vitamin C used in this study were not stabilized—although niacinamide itself is very stable. The base of the formula used in this study was also far different than today’s sophisticated skincare formulas. Today, cosmetic chemists know how to combine niacinamide and vitamin C in the ideal base formulas that enhance their compatibility.  The other common concern we’ve seen about combining these two ingredients has to do with the pH range. The concern is that the acidic environment ascorbic acid needs to be most effective will cause niacinamide will convert to nicotinic acid, a form that can be sensitizing, possibly inducing redness. Good news: This conversion process would only happen under conditions of the formula being exposed to very high heat for a long period of time. This would not apply to layering skincare products or to heat conditions that occur during manufacturing, transport, and storage of cosmetic products that contain niacinamide and ascorbic acid.What all of this means is that you can use or layer products containing both niacinamide and vitamin C knowing that they will not render each other any less effective. Each of these ingredients on its own can help to address dark spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dullness. When used together, they become even more of a powerhouse! This duo will help give you an even better chance at achieving a radiant, smooth, even, younger-looking complexion.

Although octinoxate does provide some UVA protection, it does not protect against the entire range of UVA wavelengths; therefore, there should be another UVA-protecting active present in any sunscreen you use.Octinoxate has a solid record of safety (decades of research and thousands of studies establishing its safety in sunscreens as indisputable). There are no studies that demonstrate octinoxate, when and as used in SPF products, is harmful. In the sole studies cited when such claims are made, the conditions are completely inapplicable to how sunscreen ingredients are used in skincare products. For example, such “studies” use extremely high concentrations of octinoxate (much higher than would ever be used in sunscreens) or even fed to lab animals. There simply isn’t any research backing the claim that octinoxate has any link to health risks when used in sunscreen formulas. In fact, the European Union’s permitted usage level for octinoxate in sunscreens is higher than the maximum amount permitted in the United States (7.5% in the United States, 10% in the EU).This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.References for this information:Pharmazie, 2013, issue 1, pages 34-40Skin Pharmacology and Physiology, 2005, issue 4, pages170-174",3

It’s the primary fatty acid in olive oil, and believed to play a role in this oil’s cholesterol-lowering benefits when consumed orally. Interestingly, research has shown that topical application of oleic acid on its own or as olive oil can disrupt skin’s barrier; however, this effect was not observed when oleic acid was blended with other fatty acids and skin-beneficial ingredients. On the upside, this kind of barrier disruption can enhance penetration of other ingredients naturally present in plant oils or in the product, so it’s not necessarily all bad (and, as we mentioned, not bad at all unless you’re applying pure oleic acid or straight olive oil to skin). In another interesting twist, combining oleic acid with other lipids (fats) boosts its skin-calming ability, thus making oleic acid useful for reducing signs of dryness and sensitivity. In cosmetics, oleic acid is used as a cleansing agent and texture enhancer. It’s among the more stable fatty acids, and has a unique ability to preserve the effectiveness of more delicate ingredients such as antioxidants by helping to protect them from light and air degradation.

It is part of the benzophenone group of chemicals.Oxybenzone is approved for use in specific concentrations for sunscreens sold in all major countries, including the United States, Canada, European Union countries, Japan, Australia, China, and South Korea. Its safety in sunscreens is well established.As a group, the benzophenones are used not only for sun protection but also as photostabilizers in cosmetics products. That means they keep products from turning color or from degrading in the presence of sunlight. They also have other uses, including flavor enhancers in food.Oxybenzone is sometimes called out as a sunscreen active that is damaging to undersea coral reefs, the theory being that the sunscreen gets into the water from human activity in the oceans. However, despite research showing oxybenzone negatively impacts coral components in vitro (meaning in a lab setting), there doesn’t seem to be conclusive causation in a marine environment, especially given the numerous other factors, including climate change, believed to be responsible for the loss of coral reefs.The Personal Care Products Council looked at the research and concluded the following: “Degradation of the world’s coral reefs is a serious concern. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program, coral reefs are threatened by an increasing array of impacts – primarily from global climate change, unsustainable fishing and other factors. There is no scientific evidence that under naturally-occurring conditions, sunscreen ingredients, which have been safely used around the world for decades, are contributing to this issue.”This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.References for this information:Archives of Environmental Containment and Toxicology, February 2016, pages 265-288Photodermatology, Photoimmunology, and Photomedicine, 2011, pages 58-67Archives of Dermatology, July 2011 pages 865-866European Commission Directorate General for Health and Consumers.

PARABENS,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/parabens.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],goodie,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plant’s own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or that they are found naturally in plants, so either source could have been the origin, not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects, but those were done in vitro (meaning in a petri dish) or, again, they were animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

PEG,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/cleansing-agents/peg-compound.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,"['Cleansing Agents', 'Emollients']",goodie,"PEG is an acronym for polyethylene glycol, an amazingly versatile ingredient in skin care products because of the many uses it has and its broad compatibility with different types of ingredients. PEG is often mixed with an array of hydrating emollients, beneficial fatty acids, and cleansing agents. In these various combinations, a PEG can be used in gentle cleansers, elegant moisturizers, sunscreens, and unique treatment products. The safety of PEG in its various forms has recently been questioned. The primary concern is that they can contain problematic impurities such as ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane. Both of these are by-products from the manufacturing process, not something natural to any form of PEG. Although this was once a concern, reputable cosmetic ingredient suppliers have long since eliminated these impurities from the finished ingredient, which makes PEGs safe for skin. What is most notable about the various forms of PEG studied to date is they have been shown to be non-irritating for skin or eyes, even when used in concentrations greater than what most skin care products contain. PEGs also widely considered non-toxic because they do not penetrate intact skin. However, as is true for even the gentlest ingredients, when skin is inflamed or compromised, the risk of irritation is increased. If you’ve seen conflicting information about PEG ingredients, it’s important to know that the conclusions were not applicable to how PEGs are used in skin care products. These studies involved feeding a large amount of PEG to animals or applying very high doses (literally hundreds of magnitudes greater than what is used in topical products) to mouse skin.

Skin is composed primarily of a protein known as keratin, so peptides have a role to play as part of a complete skincare routine—though as with any anti-aging ingredient, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic!Ongoing research has shown that all peptides have some amount of skin-restorative ability, assuming the formulation supports the type of peptide used and is packaged to protect it from degrading from light and air exposure during use (no jars!).Ironically, peptides can become unstable in water-based formulas. Further, because peptides are vulnerable to attack by enzymes, the abundant enzymes present in skin can break the peptides down to the point where they have no effect. Knowledge of these inherent weaknesses has led many ingredient manufacturing companies to produce synthetic peptides engineered to be more stable on and within skin. Such peptides can survive intact on skin and better reach their target areas—so you’ll see anti-aging benefits!Some peptides have demonstrated a remarkable skin-soothing effect, while others can improve the appearance of wrinkles, loss of firmness, and even help to soften the look of expression lines.Don’t get seduced by the notion that there’s a best peptide or peptide blend because there isn’t.

It’s often used in even lower amounts, such as when combined with other ingredients like ethylhexylglycerin. In this case, lower amounts of phenoxyethanol can be just as effective as the maximum approved amount.Phenoxyethanol is incredibly versatile: It works in a large range of formulas and pH ranges, has broad spectrum activity against many pathogens you don’t want multiplying in your skincare products, is stable, and is compatible with many other preservatives used in cosmetics.Phenoxyethanol has become the new skincare ingredient to be demonized by various retail/natural marketing cosmetic companies and websites. The controversy is similar to the absurdity over paraben preservatives. Parabens were made evil in skincare products because of studies showing they are endocrine disruptors, but parabens don’t have that property when they absorb into skin. Much like parabens, phenoxyethanol being a problem in cosmetics is based on research that has nothing to do with skincare. The negative research about phenoxyethanol is not about the cosmetics-grade version. That’s a big difference. Even plant extracts have to be purified when they are removed from the ground and put into skincare products. No one wants worms, fertilizer, heavy metals, and dirt in their products. Phenoxyethanol is the same situation, it is purified before it is used in cosmetic formulations.As with many cosmetic ingredients, concentration matters. A 100% concentration of phenoxyethanol comes with some scary warnings. For example, the Safety Data Sheet on this preservative describes it as harmful if it contacts skin, is inhaled, or gets in to the eyes. Animal studies have shown it causes reproductive and developmental toxicity—no wonder some panic is occurring! As it turns out, the animal studies were about mice being fed large doses of this preservative, not about it being applied to skin, absorbing, and then causing reproductive or developmental harm. If you fed mice mass amounts of lavender or other essential oils, they would suffer terrible consequences.The rest of the alarming studies are about using phenoxyethanol in full-strength or atypically high concentrations, not the amounts of 1% or less used in cosmetic products. Think of it as the difference between taking one sip of wine versus chugging several bottles at once!Back to topical use, research has shown that compared to many other preservatives, the incidence of a sensitized or allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol applied as used in cosmetics is rare. But the truth is all preservatives, even the natural ones, carry some risk of sensitizing skin. That’s because preservatives of any kind are meant to kill fungus, bacteria, and mold and that can negatively impact skin. Ironically, in order for natural preservatives to be effective, they have to be used in much higher amounts than synthetic preservatives, typically up to 10%. This higher amount poses irritation and sensitizing problems for skin, so natural preservatives aren’t a slam-dunk replacement for synthetics, not even close.An interesting factoid: although the phenoxyethanol used in skincare products is synthetic, this chemical occurs naturally in green tea, just like parabens occur naturally in berries and other natural foods.References for this information:Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, December 2016, page 156PLOS One, October 2016, ePublicationJournal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, June 2015, pages 1,071-1,081Cosmetics & Toiletries, 2014, issue 5, pages 24-27International Journal of Cosmetic Science, April 2011, issue 2, pages 190-196",2

The most compelling research looked at the results of a cream with phenylethyl resorcinol plus three other skin-brightening agents. The product was applied over a period of 3 months by 20 women, all of whom also used sunscreen. At the end of the study, it was determined that the women’s uneveness decreased by 43%.
The problem is we don’t know how much of this improvement is due to phenylethyl resorcinol, as it wasn’t used alone, which is the case with most products using this ingredient as a means to improve the appearance of an uneven skin tone. Until more research comes to light, this isn’t an ingredient to bank on for great results if an uneven skin tone is your concern; however, it’s fine to use in products that also contain other skin-brightening ingredients with established track records of success.

PHTHALATES,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/phthalates.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Uncategorized'],average,"Phthalates refers to a wide range of substances that are very different from one another. Some are considered safe, and others are considered to pose a potential risk. Those that are considered to be potential risks are not approved for use in consumer packaging were banned in the US as well as the EU (these are phthalates DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP). Just to be clear, these have never been used in personal care products to begin with, rather they are used for industrial products.

However, those phthalates that have proven to be safe are not banned in the US or EU (DEP, for example, AKA diethyl phthalate is used in the EU in packaging for personal care products and other consumer items, and was given broad approval of safety in 2007.
The EU (Scientific Committee on Consumer Products) did a thorough and detailed degree of research of prior and new research and found that there was no plausible risk from what trace amounts exist in packaging for personal care products.
An earlier study in 2001 in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology already arrived at this conclusion so far as the risk of DEP in personal care products.
What is often cited as a risk by crusaders is either phthalates that are not present in personal care, food or medical device packaging materials (therefore not applicable) or studies that utilize massive doses of a type of types of phthalates (beyond what would be possible in humans).
Bisphenol A (BPA) is sometimes confused with phthalates, but is a completely unrelated substance. Either way, BPA also has been demonstrated, exhaustively, to be safe for use in packaging for food or cosmetics. In 2007, the EU found them safe. In 2009, a study published in Critical Reviews in Toxicology found that BPA poses no risk from to humans. In 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the FDA found (repeatedly) that BPA is safe as used in packaging for food and cosmetics.

They’re supposed to be as effective as AHAs, but less sensitizing. Gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between them and AHAs is that gluconolactone and lactobionic acid have larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for sensitizing side-effects. Supposedly, this reduced absorption into the skin does not hamper their effectiveness. Does that mean gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are better for your skin than AHAs in the form of glycolic acid or lactic acid? According to an Internet-published class lecture by Dr. Mark G. Rubin, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, research on gluconolactone demonstrated only a “6% decrease in dermal penetration” in comparison to glycolic acid, which “isn’t a dramatic improvement.” Gluconolactone may be slightly less sensitizing for some skin types, but this isn’t the magic bullet for exfoliation some cosmetics companies have been extolling. Polyhydroxy acids can also function as antioxidants and may promote some amount of improvement in skin’s surface strength.References for this information:Clinics in Dermatology, September-October 2009, pages 495-501Cutis, February 2004, Supplement, pages 3-13",3

These sites also state that tests show it’s a strong skin sensitizer. They further point out that the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on propylene glycol warns users to avoid skin contact. As ominous as this sounds, it’s so far from the reality of cosmetics formulations that almost none of it holds any water or poses any real concern. In fact, research from toxicologists has shown that propylene glycol and similar ingredients don’t present a health risk for people when used in cosmetics. It’s important to realize that the MSDS refers to a 100% concentration of a substance. Even water and salt have frightening comments regarding their safety according to their MSDS reports. In cosmetics, propylene glycol is used in small amounts to keep products from melting in high heat or from freezing. It also helps active ingredients penetrate skin. In the amounts used in cosmetics, it’s not a concern in the least.The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board and other groups have analyzed all of the toxicology data and exposure studies concerning topical application of propylene glycol as commonly used in cosmetics products.

PROPYLPARABEN,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/propylparaben.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Preservatives'],goodie,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help.

Retinol is a powerhouse ingredient that has value for skin on several fronts: It’s a skin-restoring, wrinkle-smoothing, firming ingredient and an antioxidant, allowing it to improve a variety of skin concerns, most related to visible signs of aging. Packaging is a key issue, so any container that lets in air (like jar packaging) or sunlight (clear containers) just won’t cut it. Lots of retinol products come in unacceptable packaging; these should be avoided because the retinol will most likely be (or quickly become) ineffective. Look for opaque, airless, or air-restrictive packaging. Many consumers are concerned about the percentage of retinol in anti-aging products such as serums or moisturizers. Although the percentage can make a difference (especially if it’s too low), it’s not helpful in understanding how a retinol product will benefit your skin. Far more important is the delivery system, packaging, and the other ingredients present with the retinol.  Using a product with a range of anti-aging ingredients plus retinol is far more valuable for skin than using a product with only a supposedly high percentage of retinol. Skin needs far more than any one ingredient can provide, however great that one ingredient may be. See our article on this topic for detailed information. There are several myths about using retinol with other anti-aging ingredients or products, such as those with vitamin C or exfoliants like glycolic acid. See our article on this topic to learn what the research has shown to be true.

Research has shown it to be an effective antioxidant when applied to skin. You may be surprised to learn that retinyl palmitate is found naturally in our skin, where it works as an antioxidant, particularly in regard to helping protect skin from UV light exposure—though it does not replace the need for sunscreen. Reports that retinyl palmitate is not a safe ingredient are false. They’re based on a study from nearly 20 years ago that has never been reproduced or tested under real-life conditions such as how people use sunscreens that contain this ingredient. In addition, to date, there is no scientific evidence that retinyl palmitate is a carcinogen in humans. The safety of retinyl palmitate is supported by several accredited organizations and their opinions are widely available online. If you still have concerns, we encourage you to research the topic further.References for this information:Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology, February 2016, pages 394-403Acta Biochimica Polonica, 2015, pages 201-206Clinical Interventions in Aging, December 2006, pages 327-348Journal of Investigative Dermatology, November 2003, pages 1163-1167",3

Retinyl retinoate has been shown, in limited but promising research (most coming from the same team of Korea-based researchers), to be less sensitizing than retinoic acid (prescription-strength) and cosmetic retinol. Retinyl retinoate may be less sensitizing than pure retinol because of its slower conversion in skin to retinoic acid. However, when it comes to sensitivity from retinol, there’s much that can be done using time-release delivery systems and ingredient additions to maximize its benefits to skin while minimizing, if not eliminating, its risk of sensitivity.
Although there’s reason to consider retinyl retinoate if your skin seems intolerant of cosmetic retinol, it shouldn’t be construed as better or safer for skin than such alternatives.

In China, the extract is known as Huang-Qin or golden herb, because the root is a golden yellow color. It’s primarily used in cosmetics for its promising ability to interrupt the creation and transfer of excess pigment; however, these scientific studies were done in vitro on skin cells, not intact skin on people struggling with dark spots, so what seems exciting in a lab setting may not hold as much promise for topical use. The other issue is the current lack of agreement on how much of this root extract is needed to visibly fade skin discolorations; some say 0.1% is enough, others recommend at least a 1% concentration is necessary, and some blends with this ingredient encourage amounts of 3-10% if the goal is visible improvement of skin color. The root is more exciting because it contains baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A, all of which are flavones, a type of antioxidant that lend color to various plants and are known to be soothing. Scutellaria baicalensis root can help skin better withstand environmental aggressors that can worsen the look of many common skin concerns, so it certainly has value. Testing on mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig skin revealed that a standardized extract of this ingredient is not irritating or sensitizing, even when the skin was compromised. The conclusion was that Scutellaria baicalensis is a viable option for sensitive skin struggling with signs of uneven skin tone or just in need of soothing.

The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients. There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone.Claims that silicones in any form cause or worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow “suffocate” skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all of the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are apparently myths or based on anecdotal evidence.Because of silicone’s unique molecular properties, they are at the same time porous and resistant though not impermeable to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released into the water. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it’s mixed with “steep” through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the “actives” to get through. The special molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they still offer protection against moisture loss.Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide.Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use. These types of cosmetic silicones are effective, inert, and versatile ingredients that benefit skin and hair in numerous ways.References for this information:International Journal of Pharmaceuticals, March 2017, pages 158-162Molecular Therapy, June 2017, pages 1342-1352 Plastic Reconstructive Surgery Global, December 2016, e1183 Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, December 2016, pages 13-20 Frontiers in Pharmacology, May 2015, ePublication International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding, May-June 2015, pages 223-230 International Journal of Toxicology, May-June 2013, pages 5S-24S Dermatology Research and Practice, October 2010, ePublication Cutis, October 2008, pages 218-284 http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/formulating/category/antiaging/34408409.html",2

Silymarin occurs in milk thistle fruit and seeds, and helps shield skin from the visible effects of UV light exposure (of course, you still need a broad spectrum sunscreen). Silymarin also has research on its role in interrupting pathways in skin that lead to discolorations on skin’s surface, while that and other compounds in milk thistle seem, at least in a lab setting, to have an inhibitory effect on enzymes that degrade collagen. In short, it’s an impressive antioxidant to see in skin care products, particularly those that address environmental stressors.

Doing so helps keep skin looking and feeling soft, smooth, and supple—especially skin that's persistently dry, tight, and uncomfortable. 
Daily application of skin-replenishing ingredients keeps skin safeguarded from environmental factors that lead to moisture loss and dehydration, and help skin appear younger, more vibrant, and replenished!
There are numerous skin-replenishing ingredients to consider, some of which are naturally present in skin, including hyaluronic acid, ceramides, sodium PCA, glycerin, glycerol, cholesterol, and phospholipids. 
Other examples of research-proven skin-replenishing ingredients are silicones, petrolatum, triglycerides, omega fatty acids, and exfoliating ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs like glycolic acid) and beta hydroxy acid (BHA, salicylic acid).

Sodium lauryl sulfate isn’t a great ingredient in terms of its impact on skin, but its effects are not detrimental to one’s health.References for this information:Journal of Clinical & Experimental Dermatology Research, November 2014, ePublicationBritish Journal of Dermatology, July 2014, pages 115-123International Journal of Toxicology, July 2010, pages S151-S161Contact Dermatitis, January 2003, pages 26-32European Journal of Dermatology, September-October 2001, pages 416-419American Journal of Contact Dermatitis, May 2001, pages 28-32",0

Antioxidants flavonoids and phenolic acids in meadowsweet such as flavonoids rutoside, spiraeoside, and isoquercitrin are believed to be the key contributors to this benefit. Spiraea ulmaria is also a natural source of salicylates such as salicin, and is sometimes claimed to be a natural source of the exfoliating ingredient salicylic acid. But it doesn’t work like salicylic acid on skin because the salicylates require the digestive system to become salicylic acid--this process doesn’t happen on skin, but these compounds share salicylic acid’s redness-calming benefits. This plant extract seems to inhibit an enzyme in skin (5-alpha reductase) that can trigger excess oil production. Therefore, it’s likely that meadowsweet will have a noticeable effect on skin’s surface oil for those struggling with oily skin.

SULFATES,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/cleansing-agents/sulfates.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Cleansing Agents'],goodie,"In cosmetics, this large group of ingredients is used mainly as cleansing agents in skincare and hair-care products; they include sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate. Many consumers are concerned of sulfates in their cosmetics products because of widespread misinformation. Sulfates are not a problem, but once organizations and companies build up fears among consumers about certain cosmetics ingredients there’s almost no going back, the damage is done.In reality there’s absolutely no research showing that sulfates are a problem in skincare or hair-care products, other than causing sensitivity, but that is also true for the sulfate-free cleansing agents that some cosmetics companies advertise and sell. And, whether or not a cleansing agent will cause sensitivity depends on the amount of sulfate and on other ingredients present in a specific formula.Following are some of the most typical unsupported comments about sulfates: “Sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers are better for hair and skin.” No research has shown that to be even remotely the case. Sulfates are supposed to be terribly drying and damaging to hair, when in fact they function no differently from the cleansing agents in sulfate-free shampoos. Almost every company that touts the fact that they don’t contain sulfates do use detergent cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate.Why those are supposedly any better for skin is never explained, and no research is ever cited—because none exists. Sometimes these companies list those ingredients as being derived from or coming from coconut to make them sound natural and, by association, better for skin—but they all end up being primarily synthetic. That doesn’t make them bad in any way; it’s just that the claims are completely disingenuous. What you need to know is that both the sulfate-free cleansing agents and the sulfate versions can be drying and sensitizing depending on the formulation and/or your skin’s own reaction. All of these cleansing agents remove oil and the gunk from styling products, which is exactly what a shampoo should do.“Sulfates in cleansers are cheap.” This one is true, but so what? Lots of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are cheap, others are expensive, which has absolutely nothing to do with quality or efficacy. The first ingredient in sulfate-free shampoos is water (about 90% water) and no other cosmetic ingredient is cheaper than that!“Sulfates are used in floor cleaners and are corrosive.” This can be true, when used in large amounts and when left on surfaces over time, but so what? Salt is used to melt ice on the roadway, but it also rusts cars, which doesn’t make salt bad; it just depends on how much you use and how long you leave it on something. This is also true for the alternative sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers as well; they can also be corrosive over time depending on how much is used and how long it is left on.“Sulfates can be sensitizing.” This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that’s NOT because it’s a sulfate; rather, it’s because of its interaction with skin.",2

TALC,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/talc.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],average,"Naturally occurring mineral composed of magnesium, hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon which combine to form what’s known as anhydrous (contains no water) magnesium silicate. Talc is often the main ingredient in loose and pressed face powders, powder foundations, and body powders for adults and children. It may also be used in skin care products where it serves as an absorbent. Talc is also used in some liquid foundations and concealers, where it adds opacity and contributes to the makeup’s texture. An ongoing concern with talc since the 1970s has been whether it contains asbestos fibers known as chrysotile, which pose a serious risk to lung health when inhaled. Talc can become contaminated with these fibers during the mining process because asbestos (also a naturally-occurring mineral) is found in nature in close proximity to talc. This is why the selection of talc mining sites is so important, as is screening all talc batches for the presence of asbestos fibers. The screening process mentioned above is something the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively doing with commercially-available talc-containing products for several years. They’re routinely announcing to the public which talc-containing products do and do not contain asbestos. Thankfully, the majority of such products do not contain this carcinogen and are considered safe when used as directed. Talc-containing products that testing shows do have asbestos are routinely recalled. This includes talc-based body powders from major brands like Johnson & Johnson, who’ve been subject to ongoing litigation concerning allegations of the presence of asbestos in their talc products. Consumers who remain concerned about whether the talc-containing products they use contain asbestos are advised to contact the brand and ask about batch certification testing to ensure the safety of these products. But we must acknowledge the public record the talc industry at large has of providing misleading information in order to conceal potential risk, justifying ongoing consumer skepticism. Alternately, you may wish to avoid all personal care products that contain talc and seek alternatives such as those made with other absorbents like corn starch, rice powder, silica, boron nitride, nylon-12, and responsibly-mined mica, or various other non-talc ingredients. Overall, despite ongoing controversies and legal issues, asbestos-free talc is considered safe for use in makeup and skin care, although it’s recommended to avoid applying loose powder talc in the genital area. According to the formal safety assessment completed in 2015, “Industry specifications state that cosmetic-grade talc must contain no detectable fibrous, asbestos minerals.” They go on to caution that “Talc should not be applied to the skin when the epidermal barrier is missing or significantly disrupted”, which makes sense given talc is not meant to get into the body, it is meant to stay on skin’s surface.Last Updated: March 2020References for this information:Epidemiology, November 2019, pages 783-788American Journal of Public Health, July 2019, pages 969-974JNCI Cancer Spectrum, April 2018, ePublicationRisk Analysis, May 2017, pages 918-929; and July 2016, ePublicationInternational Journal of Toxicology, July-August 2015, Supplement, pages 66S-129SEuropean Journal of Cancer Prevention, November 2011, pages 501-507; and April 2008, pages 139-146",1

It protects skin from UVA and UVB radiation and is considered no risk of skin sensitivity. Because its gentle, titanium dioxide is a great sunscreen active for sensitive, redness-prone skin. It’s great for use around the eyes, as it is highly unlikely to cause stinging. Titanium dioxide is typically micronized and coated for use in cosmetics products. The micronizing makes this somewhat heavy-feeling ingredient easier to spread on skin, plus a bit more cosmetically elegant. Micronized titanium dioxide is much more stable and can provide better sun protection than non-micronized titanium dioxide. Micronized titanium dioxide doesn't penetrate skin so there’s no need to be concerned about it getting into your body. Even when titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used, the molecular size of the substance used to coat the nanoparticles is large enough to prevent them from penetrating beyond the uppermost layers of skin. This means you’re getting the sun protection titanium dioxide provides with no risk of it causing harm to skin or your body. The coating process improves application, enhances sun protection, and prevents the titanium dioxide from interacting with other ingredients in the presence of sunlight, thus enhancing its stability. It not only makes this ingredient much more pleasant to use for sunscreen, but also improves efficacy and eliminates safety concerns. Common examples of ingredients used to coat titanium dioxide are alumina, dimethicone, silica, and trimethoxy capryl silane. Titanium dioxide as used in sunscreens is commonly modified with other ingredients to ensure efficacy and stability. Examples of what are known as surface modifier ingredients used for titanium dioxide include stearic acid, isostearic acid, polyhydroxystearic acid, and dimethicone/methicone copolymer. Some websites maintain titanium dioxide is inferior to zinc oxide, another mineral sunscreen whose core characteristics are similar to those of titanium dioxide. The reality is titanium dioxide is a great broad-spectrum SPF ingredient and is widely used in all manner of sun-protection products. What gets confusing for some consumers is trying to decipher research that ranks sunscreen ingredients by a UV spectrum graph. By most standards, broad-spectrum coverage for sunscreen ingredients is defined as one that surpasses 360 nanometers (abbreviated as “nm” - how the sun’s rays are measured). Titanium dioxide exceeds this range of protection, but depending on whose research you read, it either performs as well as or slightly below zinc oxide. It’s true that titanium dioxide does not rank as high for UVA protection as zinc oxide, it ends up being a small difference (think about it like being 10 years old versus 10 years and 3 months old). This is not easily understood in terms of other factors affecting how sunscreen actives perform (such as the base formula), so many, including some dermatologists, assume that zinc oxide is superior to titanium dioxide for UVA protection. When carefully formulated, titanium dioxide provides excellent UVA protection. Its UVA protection peak is lower than that of zinc oxide, but both continue to provide protection throughout the UVA range for the same amount of time.

TRANEXAMIC ACID,https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/miscellaneous/tranexamic-acid.html?fdid=ingredient-dictionary&csortb1=name&csortd1=1,['Miscellaneous'],superstar,"Tranexamic acid is a synthetic amino acid derived from lysine. Topically, tranexamic acid works by interrupting at least two pathways in skin that, left unchecked, can lead to discolorations, including larger patches known as melasma. Tranexamic acid also seems to work within skin’s surface layers to make skin color less susceptible to UV light exposure (but of course, you still need sunscreen) and may also reduce redness. Recent, double-blind and comparative research has shown that topical tranexamic acid in amounts between 2-5% rivals results of over-the-counter amounts of hydroquinone, long considered the gold standard for fading skin discolorations. If you’re using a hydroquinone product, you can add a product with tranexamic acid and potentially see even better results. Comparative studies have shown tranexamic acid has greater tolerability than hydroquinone, although the latter is generally well tolerated when used as directed. Research has shown that tranexamic acid is safe when applied to skin every day for several months. Topical concentrations between 2-5% typically shows results after two to three months of once- or twice-daily usage. Note: Because tranexamic acid is a water soluble ingredient, it needs to be used in skin care products with oil-soluble ingredients designed to improve its penetration into skin. It’s worth mentioning that tranexamic acid is sometimes prescribed for oral use to women experiencing heavy periods or to those with various clotting disorders. It’s also used orally in low doses to manage signs of melasma. Research has revealed that how tranexamic acid works in the body to prevent excessive bleeding is very different from how it works topically as a cosmetic ingredient meant to visibly fade discolorations.

It contains curcumin, a lipophilic, polyphenolic antioxidant pigment that gives turmeric its golden-yellow color. In addition to being a food seasoning, turmeric has numerous health benefits whether consumed orally vis foods and supplements or applied topically. Ongoing research has shown turmeric and the curcumin it contains play a safe and compelling role in promoting healthier, normalized skin. On skin, in vivo research has shown that turmeric and its derivatives interrupt signaling in surface cells that trigger signs of irritation. Turmeric helps calm skin and may even play a role in reducing the look of acne-related redness by modulating pathways to restore a healthier, more even appearance. Research has conclusively shown that turmeric is a potent antioxidant, largely due to its curcumin content (although turmeric also contains other antioxidants). Applying turmeric to skin can help offset signs of environmental damage and, to some extent, thwart the skin-damaging effects from UVB light. As with many antioxidants, turmeric requires protection from air and light, as routine exposure causes it to break down and limits its availability to skin. Beyond being an antioxidant, some research has shown the curcumin portion of turmeric boosts skin’s hyaluronic acid content, meaning turmeric can also be considered hydrating.

In vitro (test tube) research has shown this type of algae plays a disruptive role in the pathway melanin (skin pigment) takes to make it to skin’s surface.

The sun produces a range of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, of which UVA and UVB affect our skin. UVA rays have wavelengths of 320 to 400 nanometers; UVB rays have wavelengths of 290 to 320 nanometers. UVB radiation causes sunburn, while UVA radiation does not produce any visible short-term evidence of skin damage. Nonetheless, UVA radiation creates serious cumulative changes in skin that may be far greater than the sunburn caused by UVB radiation. Research has shown that unprotected exposure to UVA rays can, within one week, create distinct injury. Research also indicates UVA exposure is even more damaging than we once knew: it seems that when UVA radiation hits skin, it not only penetrates to skin’s lower layers but the damage “bounces back” like light reflecting from a mirror, giving every layer of your skin a double-whammy of damage. UVA radiation prompts tanning, yes, but the tan you see is direct evidence of your skin responding, as best it can, to the onslaught of damage it just endured.To be truly effective and beneficial for skin, sunscreens must protect skin from both the sun’s UVA and UVB radiation. In the United States, there are four ingredients approved by the FDA that protect across the full UVA range: titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone (also called Parsol 1789 and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane).",0

A safety assessment of different types of vanilla by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review board revealed that while Vanilla planifolia was non-irritating and non-sensitizing, another form known as Vanilla tahitensis triggered irritation and sensitization when tested on human skin at a relatively low level (0.8%).

A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology (April 2004, page 73) examined the effect of applying a gel containing 2% vitamin K plus 0.1% retinol, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Fifty-seven adults with dark circles participated in this 8-week study and the results, while not a slam-dunk, weren't exactly discouraging either: 47% of the testers noted ""fair to moderate"" improvement in their dark circles. 
The majority of testers noticed no change, but the ingredient was well-tolerated. As encouraging as this seems, whether or not the results were from the vitamin K or the other vitamins is unknown.
A minimum 1% concentration of vitamin K1 has been shown in animal studies to positively influence wound healing by hastening the natural process damaged skin undergoes as it works to repair itself. It is not known if this principle would apply to intact skin showing signs of aging. 
The same concentration of vitamin K1 was used in another study to test its results on improving the look of dark circles. Although some improvement was noted, the formula in testing also contained caffeine and emu oil, although the study’s authors concluded that the dark circle benefits were solely attributed to vitamin K.
Interestingly, despite somewhat encouraging research, we rarely see products that contain (or are likely to contain) the amounts of vitamin K research has shown can be beneficial.

Studies that have compared the water content of dry skin with that of normal or oily skin do not find a statistically significant difference in moisture levels between them.
Further, too much water can be a problem for skin because it can disrupt the essential substances in skin's surface layers that keep it intact, smooth, and healthy-looking.

There is research showing that white and green teas have the highest concentration of antioxidant properties (via their polyphenol and flavonoid content) of all teas. However, even though tea flavonoids are effective antioxidants, it is unclear to what extent they increase the antioxidant capacity of humans.
It appears that white and green teas have similar amounts of the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the main antioxidant in tea. The conclusion is that white and green tea have nearly identical antioxidant activity, and both are great antixoidants to look for in skincare products.

Further, salicin, much like salicylic acid, is stable only under acidic conditions. The likelihood that willow bark in the tiny amount used in cosmetics can mimic the effect of salicylic acid is at best questionable, and, in all likelihood, impossible. However, willow bark may have soothing benefits for skin.

However, witch hazel’s high tannin content (tannin is a potent antioxidant) can also make it sensitizing if used repeatedly on skin. The bark of the witch hazel plant has a higher tannin content than the leaves. Producing witch hazel water by steam distillation removes the tannins, but the plant’s astringent qualities are what most believe give it benefit.Alcohol is added during the distillation process, the amount typically being 14–15%. Witch hazel water is distilled from all parts of the plant; therefore, you never know exactly what you’re getting, although the alcohol content remains.Depending on the form of witch hazel, you’re exposing your skin either to an sensitizing amount of alcohol or to tannins, or both. Moreover, witch hazel contains the fragrance chemical eugenol, which is another source of sensitivity.

In the plant world, xylitol naturally occurs in many fruits and vegetables, including mushrooms, lettuce, strawberries, bananas, and yellow plums. Research has shown that, like the skin-replenishing ingredient glycerin, xylitol hydrates and helps strengthen skin’s barrier. Xylitol also has an influential role in normalizing skin and the natural process keratinocytes (skin cells) go through as they work their way from the lower to the upper layers to the surface. Part of this is due to its ability to squelch damaging factors in skin that would otherwise throw skin’s natural processes off track. Xylitol is considered a nutritive sweetener and when added to foods or foods that naturally contain xylitol are eaten, research has shown it has prebiotic action that positively influences the gut microbiome. Xylitiol is a source of galactooligosaccharides, which are primary responsible for its prebiotic ability. Whether or not this prebiotic benefit also occurs from topical application of xylitol in skin care is unconfirmed; however, topical use clearly has well established benefits for skin.

In recent years, there have been concerns about the use of nano-sized zinc oxide in sunscreen formulations. Nanotechnology is about taking a material and making it much smaller than its original size. In the case of zinc oxide, nanotechnology is used to make it more aesthetically pleasing, as well as enhance its SPF. Nano-sized zinc oxide is not believed to be a safety concern for skin.
