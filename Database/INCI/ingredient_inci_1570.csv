His work resulted in the FDA-approved Iamin\xa0hydrating gel to treat acute and chronic wounds.', 'Helping wound healing does not seem like a big deal. If you read around INCIDecoder you can read the same about plenty of other ingredients, but GHK-Cu does have a special feature; it can stimulate the breakdown of unhealthy, too large collagen in scar tissue and can help stimulate nice and healthy normal collagen production. \xa0And less bad collagen and more good collagen results in smoother, nicer skin.', 'Helps good collagen production\rHelping collagen production is a big deal in anti-aging skincare and there are very few ingredients that are really proven to do so. Copper-tripeptide is only half-way proven at this point but there are definitely promising results about it. Dr. Pickart himself made a successful in-vitro (made in test tubes, not on real people) study in 1988 showing that CHK-Cu can stimulate collagen synthesis.', 'There is an even more promising study from 1998 that was done on people and compared vitamin C, tretinoin, and copper-tripeptide.

After one month, it increased collagen production in 70% of people, while vitamin C only in 50% and tretinoin only in 40%.', ""More anti-aging magic properties\rIf the above isn't enough, there is more. GHK-Cu seems to have a complex role in skin health\xa0and tissue repair. It does not only help collagen synthesis but also the synthesis of other important skin-identical ingredients like elastin, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans. It also has an\xa0antioxidant effect by stimulating the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and preventing the release of oxidation-promoting iron."", 'There are also a couple of facial studies showing that GHK-Cu containing creams can do pretty much everything you need for younger looking skin. It can tighten loose skin and improve elasticity, density, and firmness. It can reduce fine lines as well as deeper wrinkles. It can improve skin clarity and even reduce hyperpigmentation.', 'Improving Hair Growth\rWhile studying the wound healing properties of GHK-Cu, Dr. Pickart also noticed\xa0that\xa0after treating skin wounds\xa0there was an enlargement of the hair follicles of the skin at the wound edge. This led him to discover that skin remodelling copper peptides (SRCPs) can also stimulate hair growth. It works by stimulating follicular cell proliferation that results in larger hair follicles that produce longer and thicker hair. \xa0SRCPs also keep\xa0the hair follicles longer in the active, anagen phase and shorter in the inactive, dormant phase.', ""So what's the catch? \rWell, most studies done on copper-tripeptide are in-vitro (meaning in the lab and not on real people) or on animals. Results may or may not be the same on us, people. There are some facial studies that are promising, but they are quite small and not designed to the strictest standards (by which we mean double blind, placebo controlled.)"", 'Another catch is that when it comes to facial anti-aging skin care stimulating hair growth is not really a good thing (unless of course, more facial hair is ok for you). Dr. Pickart himself tells this about the issue: \xa0""The SRCPs increase the size of hair follicles but do not convert the small vellus hair follicles that produce fine, nearly invisible hair (98% of body hair) into terminal follicles (2% of body hair) that produce thick, long hair. The enlarged hair follicles produce the stem cells needed to rebuild skin.\xa0Many women have used our facial products for 5 years without problems."" Reading around on skincare forums, some did see slightly more facial hair\xa0some not. This is again something that you have to try and see.', 'Last but not least there is an ""urban legend"" about the possibility to overdose on copper peptide resulting not in younger but older looking skin. We could not find any study or research paper about this but Dr. Todorov on\xa0smartskincare\xa0writes\xa0this: ""..excessive use can have an opposite effect by increasing the levels of free copper and/or by triggering excessive production of metalloproteinases. Free copper promotes free radical damage and collagen breakdown leading to accelerated skin aging. Metalloproteinases can digest collagen and elastin, weakening the skin and causing sag. These problems do not seem to occur among the majority of copper peptide users. However, there are anecdotal reports indicating that such side-effects might happen with overuse, incorrect use, or even normal use in sensitive individuals. Ideally, a sufficiently large study is needed to better quantify these risk.""', 'There you have it! If you are still here, congrats, you just became a GHK-Cu expert. :) It is definitely a very interesting and promising ingredient, so if you are into anti-aging and like to experiment this is something for you.

But as we wrote in the intro, the topic is complex and controversial so here are some of the questions that keep coming up around slathering EGF all over our face.', 'The first and biggest concern is that if EGF is so good at stimulating cell proliferation, how does it relate to cancer? Is\xa0the definition of cancer not ""cells proliferating out of control""?\xa0 Most experts agree on this answer: EGF is\xa0mitogenic (= stimulates cell proliferation) but not\xa0mutagenic (= does not alter the cell to make it cancerous).\xa0If you do not have cancer, you will not get cancer from EGF. However, if you have cancerous cells, EGF will help them to spread, just like it helps healthy cells. So if you have a lot of moles, excessive UV exposure in the past, or if you have any of the skin cancer risk factors, we suggest you should think twice about using EGF products.\xa0The same is true if you have psoriasis, a skin disease related to the abnormal growth of epidermal skin cells. You do not want to add fuel to the fire\xa0with EGF.', 'Other (less serious)\xa0concerns\xa0are if EGF can properly penetrate the skin (as it is a medium-sized, polar molecule, so a special delivery\xa0system is probably needed), if it can affect\xa0collagen synthesis (or just works on the surface plumping up only the upmost layers of the skin) and if it has beneficial effects at all when used in isolation versus when used in a ""conditioned media"" that contains lots of growth factors resembling the synergistic balance found in the skin.', 'Overall, our impression is that EGF is definitely a potent molecule. Some EGF products have a cult-like following\xa0adding anecdotal evidence to the clinical studies showing EGF has a beneficial effect on the skin. If you like experimenting, by all means,\xa0go ahead (unless you have psoriasis or high skin cancer risk factors), but if you are a better safe than sorry type, stick to daily SPF + a good retinoid product.

They are not exactly the same, but\xa0they belong to the same family. With that in mind,\xa0we will focus here on the differences, and on how the anti-aging effect of retinol measures up against the anti-aging effect of tretinoin."", 'Tretinoin is so damn effective because our skin cells have so-called retinoid receptors that interact directly with tretinoin but they cannot interact with retinol. Retinol itself is not active, and it has to be converted to retinoic acid to actually do something.', 'In theory, our skin has metabolic machinery to do the conversion which is a two-step process: retinol -- > retinaldehyde --> retinoic acid.', ""Once the conversion is complete, retinol becomes tretinoin and can do the same thing as we have detailed in our tretinoin\xa0description\xa0BUT\xa0this two-step conversion process is not very effective and the effectiveness varies from person to person. This means that\xa0retinol is much weaker than tretinoin, and it's also possible that retinol doesn't do much for you, because your skin is a lazy converter, while tretinoin still happily works."", ""So retinol (in theory) becomes retinoic acid in the skin and from there it can work it's\xa0tretinoin-magic. There are several studies proving that retinol does exhibit\xa0biological activity and causes similar changes to the\xa0skin than tretinoin (0.1% retinol concentration gives already nice results) but the question is more the extent of the effects. Luckily there are a few studies to give us an idea."", 'A study from 1997 compared the penetration and the effectiveness of retinol and retinoic acid and found that retinol penetrates better and ""retinol at 0.25% may be a useful retinoid for application without occlusion because it does not irritate but does induce cellular and molecular changes similar to those observed with application of 0.025% retinoic acid.""', 'Another 2015\xa0study confirms the ballpark number\xa0that retinol is about 10 times less potent than tretinoin. It compared\xa00.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0% retinol with the commonly available tretinoin concentrations (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%). The authors of the study concluded that ""results from this comparison study suggest that this sustained-release retinol complex containing multiple agents for optimal irritation control provides comparable improvements to tretinoin in the appearance of photo damage.""', 'A third study that we think is interesting and worth mentioning is one that did not try to determine what concentration of retinol is similar to what concentration of retinoic acid, but went the other way and compared the effects of equal concentrations (0.1%) of retinol and retinoic acid. The result of this study was that\xa0""topical retinol treatment induces similar changes in skin histology and skin related gene and protein expression as seen with retinoic acid application, and the magnitude is more than half of that from retinoic acid treatment"".', 'Of course, not only the anti-aging effects\xa0but the side effects (like irritation, skin flaking, dryness, redness)\xa0 are also milder with retinol. A mild retinol product (around 0.1%) is still proven effective and very tolerable. You have to be more careful (introduce it gradually!) with stronger versions (around 1% retinol) where both the effects and the side effects can come close to that of tretinoin.', ""Bottom line: Retinol is not the same as retinoic acid\xa0or tretinoin.

It's the real deal."", 'Before we dive deep into this topic, let\'s just clear up some vocab: the word ""retinoids"" refers to a group of compounds that are all derived from vitamin A. Retinoids include beta-carotene (the thing in orange vegetables, like carrot\xa0or \xa0sweet potato), \xa0retinol (pure vitamin A itself), and tretinoin.\xa0There are a few other forms, but let\'s not get caught up in the details too much. Retinoic acid is a kind of\xa0synonym for tretinoin, or to be exact all-trans-retinoic-acids\xa0are exactly the same as tretinoin. FYI, tretinoin is a naturally occurring thing and can be found in good quality rosehip oil.', 'A little history\rRetinoids are not something new and the intense research into them started quite a while ago. In 1931 Paul Karrer won the Nobel prize\xa0for figuring out the structure of vitamin A. Twelve years later, retinol was successfully synthesized and since then, vitamin A derivatives started to pop up.', 'Tretinoin itself was developed in the late 1960s by two guys named James Fulton\xa0and\xa0Albert Kligman. It was originally intended to treat acne but acne patients in the clinical trials started to report smoother and less wrinkled skin so the\xa0research\xa0into its anti-aging benefits\xa0soon began. It went so well, that the data was submitted to the FDA (the authority that approves drugs in the US) and it\xa0approved tretinoin for ""use\xa0against photo damage"". Even today, tretinoin is the only thing approved by the FDA in the topical anti-aging field, so it\'s a really big deal.', 'All-around magic for skin health\rDr. Leslie Baumann writes in her great Cosmetic Dermatology book that ""there are more than 125 distinct dermatologic disorders\xa0for which there is credible evidence of retinoid efficacy"". Don\'t worry, we will not list out all of them, but if you have one (or more) of the common skin problems (like wrinkles, loss of firmness, dull skin, acne or hyperpigmentation), retinoids will improve this.', 'The reason why retinoids, especially tretinoin, are such an all-around skin problem solver is that they\xa0work on the skin at a cellular level and they\xa0make\xa0your skin cells behave in a healthy and normal way. Our skin cells contain\xa0retinoic acid receptors and tretinoin binds directly to these receptors and changes basic cell behaviour, like gene expression.', ""Anti-aging effects in more details\rWhen it comes to skin aging, collagen plays a big role. It acts like tent poles\xa0that make sure the tent fabric is nice and firm. Adding collagen to the skin from your serums/moisturizers does not work, though. It's like\xa0throwing poles at a ramshackle tent on the ground and hoping that the poles will magically fall into the right place and erect the tent, it simply does not work that way."", ""You can do two other things: one is to preserve the existing collagen in your skin as much as possible and the other is to convince the skin to create some more. The former will prevent wrinkles and loss of firmness, the latter has a chance to repair some of the existing damage. Tretinoin is great because it works in both ways. It inhibits collagen-destroying\xa0 enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases\xa0(MMPs, that are increased by UVB) and it's also proven to boost the skins own collagen synthesis."", ""If that wasn't enough, tretinoin also helps aging skin in a bunch of other ways: it stimulates\xa0not only collagen (type I and III), but\xa0other important\xa0skin elements as well, e.g. natural moisturizing factor glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), or the skin protein, filaggrin. It also makes the epidermis thicker\xa0and compacts the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum."", 'The net result of all the things tretinoin does is less wrinkled, firmer, smoother and tighter skin. Simply put, pretty much everything you could want from an anti-aging ingredient.', 'Other things tretinoin can help with\rWe have already written that tretinoin was originally developed to treat acne, and it does. It normalizes keratinization meaning that it prevents dead skin cells from sticking together and clogging the pores. Not only that, but it also makes your pores produce less sebum that helps the pores to stay nice and clean and not get clogged up by an excess sebum and dead skin cells.', 'Another notable benefit of tretinoin is skin lightening. It works by both preventing clumping of melanin in basal cells (skin cells at the bottom of the epidermis) and by accelerating epidermal turnover and so the loss of melanin. However, the skin lightening effect is not as strong as the gold-standard hydroquinone. In Tri-Luma cream, a prescription treatment for melasma, tretinoin,\xa0hydroquinone and a mild steroid are all combined to achieve clinical results.', ""What's the catch (aka side effects)\rWe often wonder why medicines, just like life, work in such a tricky way that the bigger positive effects almost always come with bigger negative side effects. This is definitely true for tretinoin and younger looking skin does not come without side effects."", 'The most common ones are irritation, skin flaking and redness. As tretinoin (and retinoids in general) boosts the proliferation of skin cells, the ""excess"" stars to visibly flake. This usually happens about 2-4 days after starting a tret\xa0treatment\xa0and it\'s kind of normal.', ""If you want fewer side effects it's good to know that more is not always better with tretinoin. A study in 1995 compared 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin creams and found that the improvement of photoaging was similar but the irritation was much bigger with the 0.1% version."", 'Another common side effect is dry (or drier) skin. It seems that tretinoin increases the amount of water that evaporates from the upper layer of the skin (this is called Trans Epidermal Water Loss) and might also decrease ceramide synthesis at least in the short term. Using a good moisturizer next to a tret treatment is a wise move.', 'You also have to know that you should not use tretinoin (and retinoids in general) when you are pregnant. If you are taking Accutane (or the EU version Roaccutane) make 100%\xa0sure not to get pregnant whilst on these treatments. If you do not take it in the form of medicine but just slather it on your face, the teratogenic effect is less established. What\'s more, there is a study from 1993 concluding that ""topical tretinoin is not associated with an increased risk for major congenital disorders"". But when it comes to pregnancy, we say it’s best to be overcautious\xa0and do not use any retinoids in any shape or form.', 'How to use\rIf you are still with us (thank you! :)) and\xa0the possible side effects have not scared you off, here are a couple of tips about starting a tretinoin treatment so that you can minimize the side effects and maximize your (skins) happiness:', ""Bottom line: If your main skin concern is anti-aging and you like to use the tried and true solution, your best bet is a tretinoin (or\xa0another retinoid) treatment.

Serious performance, A-list superstar but at the same time shows some major divaish behaviour.', 'But before we dive into it let’s just take a quick look where Vit C comes from. By the 18th century sailors noticed that if they eat plenty of citrus fruits that helps to prevent scurvy (an ugly disease that causes bleeding gums and other bad things - caused by Vit C deficiency). At that time they had no clue what it was inside citrus fruits that helped. Scientists managed to figure out only in the 1930s what Vitamin C is.', 'Since then it’s been a much researched, lovely vitamin that has turned out to have tremendous health benefits not only for our body but also for our skin. It’s the primary water-soluble antioxidant in our tissue and plays a big role in the complicated process where our skin creates some nice new skin-firming collagen.', 'So it’s really good to have plenty of Vit C in our body and in our skin but the trick is that our body cannot make it for itself (fun fact: some animals, like mice can!). We have to take it entirely from outside sources. Citrus fruits, black currants, red pepper or guava are for example awesome Vit C rich foods that you should eat regularly.', 'And here is an another trick: eating Vit C does not help our skin to have high levels of it. And of course when the sun shines upon us or when we face environmental pollution that is also not good for the Vit C levels in our skin.', 'But here is good news: putting some lovely Vit C cream or serum on our skin actually helps. So how does it help exactly? Let’s see:', 'Multiple studies showed that animal skin treated with topical ascorbic acid have less skin reddening (it’s called erythema), fewer sunburn cells, and decreased tumor formation after UV exposure.', 'What this means is that it’ a great idea to use your Vit C serum in the morning under your sunscreen (not instead of it!). \xa0For even better protection choose a serum that contains Vit E as well as it doubles the photoprotection properties of Vit C. And wait, it gets even better: Ferulic acid further doubles the photoprotection of Vit C + E.', 'So this trio, Vit C + E + Ferulic acid is really effective. If you are into protecting your skin from UV rays (and you should be if you want lovely skin for a long time) you should try a serum containing the magic trio. (BTW, this was discovered by American researcher, Sheldon Pinnell in 2005 and Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Serum was the first one on the market containing all three actives.)', 'Collagen is complicated but the most important thing to know about it is that it’s like tent pole. It helps to keep our skin firm and wrinkle free. Throwing poles on a ramshackle tent does not help. The poles do not go magically to the right place to make the tent nice and firm again. It’s the same with collagen - in a skincare product it does not really help (to be fair it has some hydrating properties, but not wrinkle erasing magic properties).', 'Boosting the collagen production of your skin helps. And Vit C can do that. In a study from 1999 a 10% Vit C serum (Cellex-C) was shown to decrease wrinkles when applied for a 3 month period. A few years later another study using a 5% Vit C cream for a 6 month period showed statistically significant improvement in skin hydration, wrinkles, glare, brown spots and skin density.', 'Helping your skin to make extra collagen is always nice and Vit C is one of the very very few ingredients that is proved to do so in peer reviewed studies. A-list superstar, right?', 'Brown spots or hyperpigmentation is just not nice and frankly it is very difficult to fade them just with skincare. But Vit C can help.

But we have started our description saying that Vit C is such a diva. So what about that? Well, here are its major diva demands:', 'If you ever tried a pure Vit C serum and you have not used it up in a month or two then you must have noticed that it changed its color and started to become brownish. Yes, that was the Vit C going wrong in the product.', 'There are some tips and tricks that help to stabilize Vit C. Low pH (below 3.5pH) or waterless formulation helps. Also some other ingredients help, like ferulic acid, glutathione, citric acid or sodium metabisulfite. These are all shown in research studies to help with the stability issues. Also protecting the formula from air and light is super important. The best is a totally airless packaging when it comes to Vit C formulas.', 'But even with all these tricks employed a potent Vit C serum can be used usually only three month after opening it. Diva, see?', 'It is water soluble and skin is just not attracted to water soluble things but rather to oil soluble things. So this makes it a little tricky for Vit C to actually get into your skin. But good news: low pH (again below 3.5pH) solves the problem, so look out for water based Vit C serums that state that they have the right pH or waterless formulas can work too.', 'Slight tingling is quite normal but if your skin is super sensitive, rosacea prone than a very potent (above 10%) Vit C serum might not be for you. You know, if there are some big advantages there will always be some disadvantages too. That’s just how it is.

Retinol is like a grandkid, it has to be converted (through two steps) in the skin to become retinoic acid.

Yes, you are right, Retinal is the intermediate step between\xa0retinoic acid and retinol, meaning it needs only one conversion step to become active in the skin. If we go with our royal family\xa0analogy, Retinal is Prince Charles, directly next in line to the throne.', 'Once retinal is converted, it becomes retinoic acid and does the same things we detailed in our tretinoin description. In a nutshell, it is everything you expect from an anti-aging superstar such as decreased wrinkles, smoother, firmer and more elastic skin.', 'This sounds good, but how does Retinal compare to retinoic acid? Good question! We found a study (a pretty good one with 125 patients) that compared 0.05% retinal with 0.05% retinoic acid (and vehicle).\xa0 They concluded that ""at week 18, a significant reduction of the wrinkle and roughness features was observed with both retinaldehyde and retinoic acid."" and the difference between the two was not statistically significant. (Interestingly, in both groups, the results were less significant at week 44, so\xa0it might be a good idea to have a retinoid break from time to time?) Also, our guy, Retinal was much better tolerated than retinoic acid known for its harshness.', 'The good\xa0tolerability of retinal was also confirmed by another study that compared retinol (ROL), retinal (RAL) and retinoic acid (RA). They found that ""the natural retinoids ROL and RAL do have a good tolerance profile, in contrast with the irritating potential of RA"", meaning retinal is an awesome alternative if you have irritation and flaking issues with prescription products, such as Retin-A.', 'Last, but not least, we want to mention a pretty big (but subjectively evaluated), Avene (the French pharmacy brand famous for its Retinal products) sponsored study that examined the tolerability and efficacy of a 0.1 Retinal + 6% glycolic acid product in the treatment\xa0of acne. The product was added next to the standard anti-acne regimen of\xa01,709 patients for 90 days and the study concluded that the formula was both very well tolerated as well as effective next to other standard anti-acne medications such as benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics.', 'Overall, if you are into retinoids, Retinal is a really awesome and well-proven member of the family that is absolutely worth trying.']"

This puts\xa0our molecule in the place of little Princess Charlotte on the family tree, quite far away from the throne.\xa0 However, not all retinol ester molecules are made equal when it comes to being transformed and being effective on the skin.', 'As Dr. Fulton (the scientist\xa0behind both Retin-A and RP) puts it in his patent paper,\xa0 ""Other esters of vitamin A obtained from, for example, palmitic acid and acetic acid do not have the therapeutic advantages found with vitamin A propionate ..... Presumably, the [Retinyl Palmitate] molecule is so large, it is not able to transdermally reach the necessary part of the skin for activity. Similarly, vitamin A acetate is too small molecularly and therefore easily recrystallizes from any solution.....vitamin A propionate is the appropriate molecular weight and configuration to both remain in a stable solution and to be transdermally delivered to a site where it is active."" So while the effectiveness of other retinol esters is highly questionable,\xa0Retinyl Propionate seems to be the most effective retinol ester molecule, and it ""unexpectedly provides all the benefits of vitamin A acid but minimizes the negative side effects"", at least according to Dr. Fulton, the inventor of the molecule.', 'We know what you are thinking! This sounds great and all, but what about some proof? Some backup data not from the inventor himself?\xa0 We looked into it and found three studies working with\xa0Retinyl Propionate.', 'In a 2007 study by Dr. Draelos,\xa0she references a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled\xa0clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of 0.15% retinol with 0.3%\xa0Retinyl Propionate.

They found that the cosmetic regimen was tolerated better, worked faster and gave comparable results. All this sounds very promising for RP, however, it is hard to know how much the other actives contributed to the positive results.', 'Last, but not least there is a study from 1998 that tested a 0.15%\xa0Retinyl Propionate cream and after 24 weeks found no statistically significant difference between the effects of the retinyl propionate cream and the placebo preparation\xa0for any of the clinical parameters of skin photoaging. However, after 48 weeks, the 0.15% RP worked wonders for\xa0actinic keratoses, a rough, scaly patch caused by UV damage (its name contains actinic, but it is not acne, has nothing to do with it (!)).', 'So, it seems that the minimum effective dose of\xa0Retinyl Propionate is larger than 0.15% which is not surprising given that it has to do three conversion steps to reach the active form, retinoic acid. But 0.3% RP (or more, obvs) seems to be an effective dose, and even though the proof is not as solid as it is for retinol itself, if you are looking for a more gentle alternative, or if you are in the mood for experimentation,\xa0Retinyl Propionate looks like a noteworthy alternative and the most promising option among retinol esters.']"

The version used in cosmetics is\xa0produced exclusively synthetically."", ""Let's look at all those skin benefits:"", '#1: Anti-aging, wrinkle-smoothing properties: With age, our skin tends to\xa0slow down in many ways.

Reduced amounts of these proteins results in poorer skin structure, reduced skin elasticity, and more wrinkles. Studies show that niacinamide can boost collagen production as well as the production of these three important proteins. That means improved skin structure and fewer wrinkles. FYI, anti-aging studies usually use 4-5% niacinamide daily for 8-12 weeks, so if you are after the anti-aging benefits try to choose a product that tells you the exact percentage of niacinamide it contains.', '#2: Skin-lightening properties: Hyperpigmentation or brown spots are really stubborn and honestly it can be really hard to make them disappear just by topical products. What you can expect for them is to fade a little and niacinamide is a great ingredient to help with that. Studies show that 2-5% niacinamide used daily for 8 weeks results in significant lightening of hyperpigmentation. When combined with amino sugar, acetyl glucosamine the results are even better.', ""What's more, niacinamide as a skin lightener works in a way different to most others. It suppresses the transfer of melanosomes (little spheres carrying the melanin pigment) from melanocytes (skin cells producing the melanin) to keratinocytes (skin cells in the top layer\xa0of the skin) while most other skin lighteners block an enzyme called tyrosinase (that plays an important role in melanin production).

But as we wrote in the intro, the topic is complex and controversial so here are some of the questions that keep coming up around slathering EGF all over our face.', 'The first and biggest concern is that if EGF is so good at stimulating cell proliferation, how does it relate to cancer? Is\xa0the definition of cancer not ""cells proliferating out of control""?\xa0 Most experts agree on this answer: EGF is\xa0mitogenic (= stimulates cell proliferation) but not\xa0mutagenic (= does not alter the cell to make it cancerous).\xa0If you do not have cancer, you will not get cancer from EGF. However, if you have cancerous cells, EGF will help them to spread, just like it helps healthy cells. So if you have a lot of moles, excessive UV exposure in the past, or if you have any of the skin cancer risk factors, we suggest you should think twice about using EGF products.\xa0The same is true if you have psoriasis, a skin disease related to the abnormal growth of epidermal skin cells. You do not want to add fuel to the fire\xa0with EGF.', 'Other (less serious)\xa0concerns\xa0are if EGF can properly penetrate the skin (as it is a medium-sized, polar molecule, so a special delivery\xa0system is probably needed), if it can affect\xa0collagen synthesis (or just works on the surface plumping up only the upmost layers of the skin) and if it has beneficial effects at all when used in isolation versus when used in a ""conditioned media"" that contains lots of growth factors resembling the synergistic balance found in the skin.', 'Overall, our impression is that EGF is definitely a potent molecule. Some EGF products have a cult-like following\xa0adding anecdotal evidence to the clinical studies showing EGF has a beneficial effect on the skin. If you like experimenting, by all means,\xa0go ahead (unless you have psoriasis or high skin cancer risk factors), but if you are a better safe than sorry type, stick to daily SPF + a good retinoid product.

FYI, tretinoin is a naturally occurring thing and can be found in good quality rosehip oil.', 'A little history\rRetinoids are not something new and the intense research into them started quite a while ago. In 1931 Paul Karrer won the Nobel prize\xa0for figuring out the structure of vitamin A. Twelve years later, retinol was successfully synthesized and since then, vitamin A derivatives started to pop up.', 'Tretinoin itself was developed in the late 1960s by two guys named James Fulton\xa0and\xa0Albert Kligman.

It went so well, that the data was submitted to the FDA (the authority that approves drugs in the US) and it\xa0approved tretinoin for ""use\xa0against photo damage"". Even today, tretinoin is the only thing approved by the FDA in the topical anti-aging field, so it\'s a really big deal.', 'All-around magic for skin health\rDr. Leslie Baumann writes in her great Cosmetic Dermatology book that ""there are more than 125 distinct dermatologic disorders\xa0for which there is credible evidence of retinoid efficacy"". Don\'t worry, we will not list out all of them, but if you have one (or more) of the common skin problems (like wrinkles, loss of firmness, dull skin, acne or hyperpigmentation), retinoids will improve this.', 'The reason why retinoids, especially tretinoin, are such an all-around skin problem solver is that they\xa0work on the skin at a cellular level and they\xa0make\xa0your skin cells behave in a healthy and normal way. Our skin cells contain\xa0retinoic acid receptors and tretinoin binds directly to these receptors and changes basic cell behaviour, like gene expression.', ""Anti-aging effects in more details\rWhen it comes to skin aging, collagen plays a big role.

The former will prevent wrinkles and loss of firmness, the latter has a chance to repair some of the existing damage. Tretinoin is great because it works in both ways. It inhibits collagen-destroying\xa0 enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases\xa0(MMPs, that are increased by UVB) and it's also proven to boost the skins own collagen synthesis."", ""If that wasn't enough, tretinoin also helps aging skin in a bunch of other ways: it stimulates\xa0not only collagen (type I and III), but\xa0other important\xa0skin elements as well, e.g. natural moisturizing factor glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), or the skin protein, filaggrin. It also makes the epidermis thicker\xa0and compacts the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum."", 'The net result of all the things tretinoin does is less wrinkled, firmer, smoother and tighter skin.

It normalizes keratinization meaning that it prevents dead skin cells from sticking together and clogging the pores. Not only that, but it also makes your pores produce less sebum that helps the pores to stay nice and clean and not get clogged up by an excess sebum and dead skin cells.', 'Another notable benefit of tretinoin is skin lightening. It works by both preventing clumping of melanin in basal cells (skin cells at the bottom of the epidermis) and by accelerating epidermal turnover and so the loss of melanin. However, the skin lightening effect is not as strong as the gold-standard hydroquinone. In Tri-Luma cream, a prescription treatment for melasma, tretinoin,\xa0hydroquinone and a mild steroid are all combined to achieve clinical results.', ""What's the catch (aka side effects)\rWe often wonder why medicines, just like life, work in such a tricky way that the bigger positive effects almost always come with bigger negative side effects. This is definitely true for tretinoin and younger looking skin does not come without side effects."", 'The most common ones are irritation, skin flaking and redness. As tretinoin (and retinoids in general) boosts the proliferation of skin cells, the ""excess"" stars to visibly flake. This usually happens about 2-4 days after starting a tret\xa0treatment\xa0and it\'s kind of normal.', ""If you want fewer side effects it's good to know that more is not always better with tretinoin. A study in 1995 compared 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin creams and found that the improvement of photoaging was similar but the irritation was much bigger with the 0.1% version."", 'Another common side effect is dry (or drier) skin. It seems that tretinoin increases the amount of water that evaporates from the upper layer of the skin (this is called Trans Epidermal Water Loss) and might also decrease ceramide synthesis at least in the short term. Using a good moisturizer next to a tret treatment is a wise move.', 'You also have to know that you should not use tretinoin (and retinoids in general) when you are pregnant. If you are taking Accutane (or the EU version Roaccutane) make 100%\xa0sure not to get pregnant whilst on these treatments. If you do not take it in the form of medicine but just slather it on your face, the teratogenic effect is less established. What\'s more, there is a study from 1993 concluding that ""topical tretinoin is not associated with an increased risk for major congenital disorders"". But when it comes to pregnancy, we say it’s best to be overcautious\xa0and do not use any retinoids in any shape or form.', 'How to use\rIf you are still with us (thank you! :)) and\xa0the possible side effects have not scared you off, here are a couple of tips about starting a tretinoin treatment so that you can minimize the side effects and maximize your (skins) happiness:', ""Bottom line: If your main skin concern is anti-aging and you like to use the tried and true solution, your best bet is a tretinoin (or\xa0another retinoid) treatment.

At that time they had no clue what it was inside citrus fruits that helped. Scientists managed to figure out only in the 1930s what Vitamin C is.', 'Since then it’s been a much researched, lovely vitamin that has turned out to have tremendous health benefits not only for our body but also for our skin. It’s the primary water-soluble antioxidant in our tissue and plays a big role in the complicated process where our skin creates some nice new skin-firming collagen.', 'So it’s really good to have plenty of Vit C in our body and in our skin but the trick is that our body cannot make it for itself (fun fact: some animals, like mice can!). We have to take it entirely from outside sources. Citrus fruits, black currants, red pepper or guava are for example awesome Vit C rich foods that you should eat regularly.', 'And here is an another trick: eating Vit C does not help our skin to have high levels of it. And of course when the sun shines upon us or when we face environmental pollution that is also not good for the Vit C levels in our skin.', 'But here is good news: putting some lovely Vit C cream or serum on our skin actually helps.

It works against multiple bacteria including the evil, acne-causing Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Very few ingredient are proven to work against P. acnes, so this alone makes azelaic acid an awesome choice for acne-prone skin.', 'For acne treatment, 20% is the standard prescription strength choice. Comparing 20% azelaic acid to other acne treatments like 0.05% retinoic acid cream, 5% benzoyl peroxide cream or 2% erythromycin ointment azelaic acid had nothing to be ashamed for as it showed similar effectiveness.', 'There is also a study that showed that 5% azelaic acid is also somewhat effective (about 32% improvement) and it can be made much more effective by combining it with 2% clindamycin (about 64% improvement.)', 'Magic property no. 2: Regulate the production of skin cells → Anti-AcneOne of our favourite beauty blogs, xoVain cites dermatologist, Dr. David Lortscher, who gives a great explanation: \xa0“Azelaic acid also works on the cells that line hair follicles by changing the way they mature and proliferate, which decreases follicular ‘plugging’ and helps prevent blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed acne lesions.” So basically it helps with healthy skin cell production in the pores that is often problematic in acne and blackhead prone skin, which is nice!', 'Magic property no. 3: Anti-inflammatory effect → Anti-rosacea, anti-acneThe third magic property of azelaic acid is that it is\xa0proven to ha an e anti-inflammatory effect. This is cool not only for treating acne, but also for treating rosacea. 15% is the standard prescription strength dose for rosacea treatment.', 'Magic property no. 4: Skin lightening effect → Anti-PIH, anti-melasmaLast but not least azelaic acid also shows\xa0skin lightening properties. It seems to be especially effective for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (that often comes with acne) and melasma. Studies have compared 20% azelaic acid to 2% and 4% Hydroquinone and here again, it has nothing to be ashamed of, azelaic acid showed similar skin lightening properties.

Next to benzoyl peroxide, it’s the gold standard ingredient for treating problem skin.', 'There are two reasons for this:', 'Reason #1: It can exfoliate skin both on the surface and in the poresAHAs are very cool, but they are water soluble and cannot go into the pores. SA is lipid soluble and it can go right into the pores and shed the stuck, dead skin cells out from there. That’s really good for treating blackheads as well as preventing acne formation.', 'This was confirmed also by a study that compared 8% AHA and 2% BHA for treating blackheads. AHA did not decrease the blackhead density statistically significantly, but BHA did.', 'Reason #2: SA is a potent anti-inflammatory\rThe chemical structure of SA is very similar to aspirin, and it does have similar anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory effect.

For the latter one, \xa0it’s only moderately effective, and benzoyl peroxide outperforms it by leaps and bounds. But they work in different ways, so a combination therapy is a great way to fight (and win) against acne. (In fact, it’s a good idea to combine SA not only with BP, but\xa0with any other antibacterial agent such as\xa0azelaic acid or mandelic acid.)', 'What else to know?\xa0For at home use 0.5-2% SA is effective and these products are usually gentle enough for daily use. In fact, in the EU 2% is the maximum strength allowed in at home products.', 'There are also professional BHA peels that go in the 20-30% range. Those can fade pigmentation, decrease surface roughness, reduce fine lines and of course, treat acne.', 'Regarding pH requirements for BHA, unlike for AHAs where\xa0an acidic pH is super important for efficacy, it might be less relevant for BHA.', 'Oh, and one more things: studies show that SA (at 2%) does not increase skin’s sun sensitivity, but it has photoprotective effects. Not that we want to tell you not to use sunscreen, because please do!', 'Bottom line: SA is a great exfoliant and anti-inflammatory and you should definitely try it if you have oily skin, large pores, blackheads or whiteheads.

First, its molecules are small (228 Da) and very lipophilic (oil loving) and these properties result in very good\xa0absorption.

In fact, it absorbs so well that 4 hours after application of a sunscreen product with BP-3,\xa0it can be detected in urine.', 'Another concern of BP-3 is that it shows some estrogenic activity, though it\'s probably not relevant when applied topically to the skin. Estrogenic activity was confirmed only in-vitro (in test tubes) and when taken orally by lab animals, and not when used topically as you would normally. In fact, a 2004 follow-up study to examine the estrogenic effect of sunscreens when used topically on the whole body found that ""the endogenous levels of reproductive hormones were unaffected"" (even though BP-3 could be detected both in plasma and urine, so its absorption is no doubt too good).', 'If that was not enough,\xa0Wikipedia claims that BP-3 is nowadays the\xa0most common allergen found in sunscreens, and the always-trustworthy\xa0smartskincare\xa0writes that ""[benzophenones] have been shown in some studies to promote the\xa0generation of potentially harmful free radicals"".', 'On the up side, sunscreens are pretty well\xa0regulated in several parts of the world, and BP-3 is considered ""safe as used"" and is an allowed sunscreen agent everywhere.

Not so much against blackheads or whiteheads, but against acne that is caused by the evil bacteria called Propionibacterium acnes (and that is most types of acne).\xa0 Apart from being antibacterial, it is also anti-inflammatory, keratolytic and wound-healing, all of which are properties that make it so darn effective against spots.', 'Another big pro of BP is that there is no bacterial resistance to it, meaning if it works once\xa0it will continue to work. Antibiotics are also a\xa0common\xa0way to treat acne, but\xa0antibiotic-resistant P. acnes are increasing worldwide. BP will probably help you even if antibiotics have stopped working, and the two are also often combined for a more complex acne therapy. Btw, BP plays nice not only\xa0with antibiotics but also with retinoids.', 'The side-effects part? BP works its antibacterial magic by being a powerful oxidizing agent,\xa0meaning it is a pro-oxidant. As in the opposite of an\xa0antioxidant. BP\xa0literally generates evil ROS (reactive oxygen species)\xa0in the skin that kills\xa0P. acnes but also harms the surrounding skin cells. Ongoing BP-use ages your skin, which\xa0is why, we say, use it as a last resort. If you do use BP, please also use a good sunscreen and a good antioxidant serum\xa0to apologise to your skin (btw, these things are useful in any case). Use the BP treatment at night and the antioxidant serum in the morning so that they do not cancel\xa0each other out.', 'Another side effect of BP is that it can be very skin drying. BP is an example where more is not better. In fact, it is equally effective at concentrations of 2.5, 5.0 and 10%, but the higher the concentration the more irritating and drying side effects occur. So using BP at 2.5% percent is the ideal amount. Another side effect which is good to know is that BP can bleach bedsheets and clothes.\xa0Be careful with your expensive satin bedsheets.', 'Overall, Benzoyl Peroxide is a uniquely effective topical acne treatment, but it comes at a price.

Drinking it and slather\xa0it all over your face are both great ideas. But as this is INCI Decoder and not a find-out-what’s-healthy-to-drink site (those sites are also cool, of course) we will now just focus on why you should put it on your face.', 'Our first reason is that green tea does not only sound good and is totally natural (not that only natural things can be good or all natural thingsare good), it’s super well researched. According to one of our fav dermatologist, dr. Leslie Baumann it’s one of the most studied antioxidants. A 2015 research summary paper on green tea stated that there are about 6000 research papers on the topic currently in PubMed (the US National Library of Medicine research database).', 'Before we dive into what the magic powers of green tea are it’s good to know that the most useful components of the tea are called polyphenols, and even more precisely catechins. There are four major types: the most abundant and active one, the real superstar is called EGCG (EpiGalloCatechin Gallate). Also significant ones are \xa0ECG (EpiCatechin Gallate), GCG (GalloCatechin Gallate) and EGC (EpiGallo Catechin), but there are also a few more types in green tea.', 'To be able to truly judge the efficacy of a green tea product dr. Baumann emphasises that it’s important to know the polyphenol content of the extract used. There can be huge quality differences between various green tea extracts depending on climate, season, age of the leaf and how it was grown. (You know it’s like the tomato that you buy middle of the summer fresh from the market vs the tomato that you buy middle of the winter from a big supermarket, and it was picked totally unripe on the other half of the word a while ago - \xa0they taste totally different).', 'According to the 2015 research summary paper an average extract contains only 10% catechins, while Dr. Todorov of the fantastic smartskincare.com site writes about 25% (vs. only 4% in black tea). Dr. Leslie Baumann says in her Cosmetic Dermatology book that a good quality green tea extract should contain 50-90% catechins and the high-quality ones are brownish and have a characteristic odor. So if you stumble upon a green a tea product that’s brown and has a distinct tea-like smell that is a great sign of a quality product.', 'Ok, so now you know that not all green tea extracts are made equal and which ones are the good ones. Let’s see those magic powers.', 'Great Antioxidant & UV protectant\rThe polyphenols in green tea are strong, proven antioxidants. That’s good because they help to protect our skin against not-so-nice little things called free radicals that are out there to destroy the very nice, firming collagen in our skin. Studies show that green tea reduces UV caused skin irritation and reddening (it’s called erythema), and decreases the number of sunburn cells. It’s a great idea to use a green tea product in the morning under your sunscreen.', 'Anticarcinogenic\xa0\rThis one partly comes from the antioxidant and UV protectant properties but we wanted to emphasise that green tea does not only give some “superficial” skin benefits but is truly a health protectant. It can inhibit DNA damage and even activates some enzymes that help with DNA repair. Thanks to this it’s very useful for preventing non-melanoma type skin cancer. So especially if your skin cancer risk factors are high (fair skin, skin cancer history in the family, blue or green eyes, past sunburns, some types of moles), introducing green tea into your skin care is a fantastic thing to do.', 'Anti-inflammatory\rInflammation is an important process that’s a biological, protective response to not nice things that happen to our body. However too much inflammation in our skin is not good: it accelerates the aging process and it’s also behind many skin diseases (acne and rosacea the most common examples). The catechins in green tea are not only amazing antioxidants but they also possess magic anti-inflammatory powers. This makes green tea an awesome choice for sensitive, rosacea or acne prone skin.', 'Anti-microbial\rThis one is probably the least well known, but green tea also shows promising anti-microbial properties against some not-nice bacteria. This property makes green tea even more awesome for acne-prone skin. We could find two promising research paper results showing that 2% green tea lotion is effective to treat mild-to-moderate acne. Also atopic dermatitis is a skin diseases that could be improved with the help of the green tea polyphenols.', 'So the bottom line is this: green tea is a real superstar with magic powers that make it an awesome ingredient to almost everybody. If you are worried about anti-aging, skin cancer prevention, acne, rosacea or atopic dermatitis, it’s an excellent idea to use a high-quality green tea product in your skincare routine.']"

The GHK part is a three amino acid peptide\xa0of glycine-histidine-lysine that can be found naturally in yucky bodily fluids (if you are wondering in plasma, saliva, and urine). The Cu part is the copper, an essential trace element in the human body (and in all living things). It turns out GHK and Cu love each other, and if they meet, they form a complex that is called copper-tripeptide."", 'Wound healing and anti-inflammatory properties\rThe guy who discovered\xa0GHK-Cu is called Dr. Pickart and in the first 15 years of his\xa0GHK-Cu studies, he found out that it helps wound healing and has anti-inflammatory properties. His work resulted in the FDA-approved Iamin\xa0hydrating gel to treat acute and chronic wounds.', 'Helping wound healing does not seem like a big deal. If you read around INCIDecoder you can read the same about plenty of other ingredients, but GHK-Cu does have a special feature; it can stimulate the breakdown of unhealthy, too large collagen in scar tissue and can help stimulate nice and healthy normal collagen production. \xa0And less bad collagen and more good collagen results in smoother, nicer skin.', 'Helps good collagen production\rHelping collagen production is a big deal in anti-aging skincare and there are very few ingredients that are really proven to do so. Copper-tripeptide is only half-way proven at this point but there are definitely promising results about it. Dr. Pickart himself made a successful in-vitro (made in test tubes, not on real people) study in 1988 showing that CHK-Cu can stimulate collagen synthesis.', 'There is an even more promising study from 1998 that was done on people and compared vitamin C, tretinoin, and copper-tripeptide. Do you know which one won? Copper tripeptide. After one month, it increased collagen production in 70% of people, while vitamin C only in 50% and tretinoin only in 40%.', ""More anti-aging magic properties\rIf the above isn't enough, there is more. GHK-Cu seems to have a complex role in skin health\xa0and tissue repair. It does not only help collagen synthesis but also the synthesis of other important skin-identical ingredients like elastin, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans. It also has an\xa0antioxidant effect by stimulating the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and preventing the release of oxidation-promoting iron."", 'There are also a couple of facial studies showing that GHK-Cu containing creams can do pretty much everything you need for younger looking skin. It can tighten loose skin and improve elasticity, density, and firmness. It can reduce fine lines as well as deeper wrinkles. It can improve skin clarity and even reduce hyperpigmentation.', 'Improving Hair Growth\rWhile studying the wound healing properties of GHK-Cu, Dr. Pickart also noticed\xa0that\xa0after treating skin wounds\xa0there was an enlargement of the hair follicles of the skin at the wound edge. This led him to discover that skin remodelling copper peptides (SRCPs) can also stimulate hair growth. It works by stimulating follicular cell proliferation that results in larger hair follicles that produce longer and thicker hair. \xa0SRCPs also keep\xa0the hair follicles longer in the active, anagen phase and shorter in the inactive, dormant phase.', ""So what's the catch? \rWell, most studies done on copper-tripeptide are in-vitro (meaning in the lab and not on real people) or on animals. Results may or may not be the same on us, people. There are some facial studies that are promising, but they are quite small and not designed to the strictest standards (by which we mean double blind, placebo controlled.)"", 'Another catch is that when it comes to facial anti-aging skin care stimulating hair growth is not really a good thing (unless of course, more facial hair is ok for you). Dr. Pickart himself tells this about the issue: \xa0""The SRCPs increase the size of hair follicles but do not convert the small vellus hair follicles that produce fine, nearly invisible hair (98% of body hair) into terminal follicles (2% of body hair) that produce thick, long hair. The enlarged hair follicles produce the stem cells needed to rebuild skin.\xa0Many women have used our facial products for 5 years without problems."" Reading around on skincare forums, some did see slightly more facial hair\xa0some not. This is again something that you have to try and see.', 'Last but not least there is an ""urban legend"" about the possibility to overdose on copper peptide resulting not in younger but older looking skin. We could not find any study or research paper about this but Dr. Todorov on\xa0smartskincare\xa0writes\xa0this: ""..excessive use can have an opposite effect by increasing the levels of free copper and/or by triggering excessive production of metalloproteinases. Free copper promotes free radical damage and collagen breakdown leading to accelerated skin aging. Metalloproteinases can digest collagen and elastin, weakening the skin and causing sag. These problems do not seem to occur among the majority of copper peptide users. However, there are anecdotal reports indicating that such side-effects might happen with overuse, incorrect use, or even normal use in sensitive individuals. Ideally, a sufficiently large study is needed to better quantify these risk.""', 'There you have it! If you are still here, congrats, you just became a GHK-Cu expert. :) It is definitely a very interesting and promising ingredient, so if you are into anti-aging and like to experiment this is something for you. If you prefer the ""tried and true"",\xa0stick to your retinol treatment.']"

The American\xa0biochemist,\xa0Stanley Cohen discovered EGF and was awarded a Noble prize in 1986 for it.

But as we wrote in the intro, the topic is complex and controversial so here are some of the questions that keep coming up around slathering EGF all over our face.', 'The first and biggest concern is that if EGF is so good at stimulating cell proliferation, how does it relate to cancer? Is\xa0the definition of cancer not ""cells proliferating out of control""?\xa0 Most experts agree on this answer: EGF is\xa0mitogenic (= stimulates cell proliferation) but not\xa0mutagenic (= does not alter the cell to make it cancerous).\xa0If you do not have cancer, you will not get cancer from EGF. However, if you have cancerous cells, EGF will help them to spread, just like it helps healthy cells. So if you have a lot of moles, excessive UV exposure in the past, or if you have any of the skin cancer risk factors, we suggest you should think twice about using EGF products.\xa0The same is true if you have psoriasis, a skin disease related to the abnormal growth of epidermal skin cells. You do not want to add fuel to the fire\xa0with EGF.', 'Other (less serious)\xa0concerns\xa0are if EGF can properly penetrate the skin (as it is a medium-sized, polar molecule, so a special delivery\xa0system is probably needed), if it can affect\xa0collagen synthesis (or just works on the surface plumping up only the upmost layers of the skin) and if it has beneficial effects at all when used in isolation versus when used in a ""conditioned media"" that contains lots of growth factors resembling the synergistic balance found in the skin.', 'Overall, our impression is that EGF is definitely a potent molecule. Some EGF products have a cult-like following\xa0adding anecdotal evidence to the clinical studies showing EGF has a beneficial effect on the skin. If you like experimenting, by all means,\xa0go ahead (unless you have psoriasis or high skin cancer risk factors), but if you are a better safe than sorry type, stick to daily SPF + a good retinoid product.

Retinol is like a grandkid, it has to be converted (through two steps) in the skin to become retinoic acid. The conversion means retinol is both less effective and less harsh on the skin.', 'So where does our current molecule, Retinal, aka\xa0Retinaldehyde fit into the family (btw, here is a nice visual family tree about who is who)?\xa0 Remember that retinol needed two conversion steps to become retinoic acid? Yes, you are right, Retinal is the intermediate step between\xa0retinoic acid and retinol, meaning it needs only one conversion step to become active in the skin. If we go with our royal family\xa0analogy, Retinal is Prince Charles, directly next in line to the throne.', 'Once retinal is converted, it becomes retinoic acid and does the same things we detailed in our tretinoin description. In a nutshell, it is everything you expect from an anti-aging superstar such as decreased wrinkles, smoother, firmer and more elastic skin.', 'This sounds good, but how does Retinal compare to retinoic acid? Good question! We found a study (a pretty good one with 125 patients) that compared 0.05% retinal with 0.05% retinoic acid (and vehicle).\xa0 They concluded that ""at week 18, a significant reduction of the wrinkle and roughness features was observed with both retinaldehyde and retinoic acid."" and the difference between the two was not statistically significant. (Interestingly, in both groups, the results were less significant at week 44, so\xa0it might be a good idea to have a retinoid break from time to time?) Also, our guy, Retinal was much better tolerated than retinoic acid known for its harshness.', 'The good\xa0tolerability of retinal was also confirmed by another study that compared retinol (ROL), retinal (RAL) and retinoic acid (RA). They found that ""the natural retinoids ROL and RAL do have a good tolerance profile, in contrast with the irritating potential of RA"", meaning retinal is an awesome alternative if you have irritation and flaking issues with prescription products, such as Retin-A.', 'Last, but not least, we want to mention a pretty big (but subjectively evaluated), Avene (the French pharmacy brand famous for its Retinal products) sponsored study that examined the tolerability and efficacy of a 0.1 Retinal + 6% glycolic acid product in the treatment\xa0of acne. The product was added next to the standard anti-acne regimen of\xa01,709 patients for 90 days and the study concluded that the formula was both very well tolerated as well as effective next to other standard anti-acne medications such as benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics.', 'Overall, if you are into retinoids, Retinal is a really awesome and well-proven member of the family that is absolutely worth trying.']"

This puts\xa0our molecule in the place of little Princess Charlotte on the family tree, quite far away from the throne.\xa0 However, not all retinol ester molecules are made equal when it comes to being transformed and being effective on the skin.', 'As Dr. Fulton (the scientist\xa0behind both Retin-A and RP) puts it in his patent paper,\xa0 ""Other esters of vitamin A obtained from, for example, palmitic acid and acetic acid do not have the therapeutic advantages found with vitamin A propionate ..... Presumably, the [Retinyl Palmitate] molecule is so large, it is not able to transdermally reach the necessary part of the skin for activity. Similarly, vitamin A acetate is too small molecularly and therefore easily recrystallizes from any solution.....vitamin A propionate is the appropriate molecular weight and configuration to both remain in a stable solution and to be transdermally delivered to a site where it is active."" So while the effectiveness of other retinol esters is highly questionable,\xa0Retinyl Propionate seems to be the most effective retinol ester molecule, and it ""unexpectedly provides all the benefits of vitamin A acid but minimizes the negative side effects"", at least according to Dr. Fulton, the inventor of the molecule.', 'We know what you are thinking! This sounds great and all, but what about some proof? Some backup data not from the inventor himself?\xa0 We looked into it and found three studies working with\xa0Retinyl Propionate.', 'In a 2007 study by Dr. Draelos,\xa0she references a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled\xa0clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of 0.15% retinol with 0.3%\xa0Retinyl Propionate. Both actives were effective in reducing the appearance of facial wrinkles and hyperpigmentation and the 0.3% RP worked a bit better.', 'Another research that was\xa0done by Procter & Gamble combined multiple anti-aging actives including niacinamide, peptides and 0.3% of\xa0Retinyl Propionate and they compared this regimen with a 0.02% tretinoin regimen. They found that the cosmetic regimen was tolerated better, worked faster and gave comparable results. All this sounds very promising for RP, however, it is hard to know how much the other actives contributed to the positive results.', 'Last, but not least there is a study from 1998 that tested a 0.15%\xa0Retinyl Propionate cream and after 24 weeks found no statistically significant difference between the effects of the retinyl propionate cream and the placebo preparation\xa0for any of the clinical parameters of skin photoaging. However, after 48 weeks, the 0.15% RP worked wonders for\xa0actinic keratoses, a rough, scaly patch caused by UV damage (its name contains actinic, but it is not acne, has nothing to do with it (!)).', 'So, it seems that the minimum effective dose of\xa0Retinyl Propionate is larger than 0.15% which is not surprising given that it has to do three conversion steps to reach the active form, retinoic acid. But 0.3% RP (or more, obvs) seems to be an effective dose, and even though the proof is not as solid as it is for retinol itself, if you are looking for a more gentle alternative, or if you are in the mood for experimentation,\xa0Retinyl Propionate looks like a noteworthy alternative and the most promising option among retinol esters.']"

If you are a chemist geek type you might want to know that the point of AHAs is that they contain a hydroxy group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid part (HO¬ =0) and these two parts are only one carbon apart (if they are two carbons apart it’s a beta-hydroxy acid).

What does it do to our skin?', 'It can exfoliateIt can gently lift off dead skin cells on the surface of your skin revealing the newer, fresher and nicer skin cells underneath. This is called exfoliation. Your skin already exfoliates itself naturally renewing the upper layer of the skin every 3-5 weeks. But as usual: this process slows down and gets faulty with age, with exposure to sun, pollution and all the usual bad stuff. So a little external help in the form of AHAs is usually very helpful! And the most awesome part: this effect is quick! With a quality AHA product, you will see pretty much immediate results in terms of fresher, smoother skin.', 'It can increase collagen synthesisFresher and smoother skin is already awesome enough to make us a fan but what really earned our superstar rating is glycolic acid’s proven ability to increase collagen synthesis. There are really only a few ingredients that can do that and glycolic acid is one of them. Actually this is the biggest benefit of glycolic acid compared to all the other AHAs. The skin firming, collagen boosting ability seems to be the best with the smallest and simplest version of all the AHAs (probably because being the smallest means also that it can penetrate the deepest). But be patient: collagen synthesis takes time, so this one is a long-term benefit. Count as much as 4-6 month to see some change.', 'It reduces hyperpigmentationBrownish spots are usually not something that we want on our face (or anywhere else...) and honestly they are really stubborn things that are hard to fade with cosmetic products. But glycolic acid is something that can help to speed up the process. Studies show that it can disperse melanin in our skin (the natural pigment that gives the color of our skin, but too much of it results in brown spots) and it’s also very useful for fading the brownish marks left after inflamed acnes (it’s called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or PIH).', 'Other nice thingsIf the above was not enough there are a couple of other promising things that glycolic acid can do.

There are a few studies that show it can improve problem skin.

Visible peeling, redness, irritation - all signs of over-exfoliation, do not do that! With a stronger product definitely start only once a week or so, and if your skin takes it well, you can increase to a couple of times a week.', 'Above 20% it’s usually professional territory. Dermatologists do skin peels at concentration up to 70%. Glycolic acid is actually the most popular “lunchtime peel”.

Or maybe even more important. Please buy an AHA product only if you know the pH value. AHAs do not work their magic if the product pH is not acidic.', 'The best practice pH range for an at home glycolic acid product is between 3-4. In this range the product is still effective but it’s also gentle to the skin. If the pH is less, glycolic acid works stronger, if the pH is more it works milder. Above pH 4, and especially above pH 5 \xa0glycolic acid loses its magic powers. On the other hand if the pH is very low it might irritate the skin.

According to one of our fav dermatologist, dr. Leslie Baumann it’s one of the most studied antioxidants. A 2015 research summary paper on green tea stated that there are about 6000 research papers on the topic currently in PubMed (the US National Library of Medicine research database).', 'Before we dive into what the magic powers of green tea are it’s good to know that the most useful components of the tea are called polyphenols, and even more precisely catechins.

Also significant ones are \xa0ECG (EpiCatechin Gallate), GCG (GalloCatechin Gallate) and EGC (EpiGallo Catechin), but there are also a few more types in green tea.', 'To be able to truly judge the efficacy of a green tea product dr. Baumann emphasises that it’s important to know the polyphenol content of the extract used. There can be huge quality differences between various green tea extracts depending on climate, season, age of the leaf and how it was grown. (You know it’s like the tomato that you buy middle of the summer fresh from the market vs the tomato that you buy middle of the winter from a big supermarket, and it was picked totally unripe on the other half of the word a while ago - \xa0they taste totally different).', 'According to the 2015 research summary paper an average extract contains only 10% catechins, while Dr. Todorov of the fantastic smartskincare.com site writes about 25% (vs. only 4% in black tea). Dr. Leslie Baumann says in her Cosmetic Dermatology book that a good quality green tea extract should contain 50-90% catechins and the high-quality ones are brownish and have a characteristic odor. So if you stumble upon a green a tea product that’s brown and has a distinct tea-like smell that is a great sign of a quality product.', 'Ok, so now you know that not all green tea extracts are made equal and which ones are the good ones. Let’s see those magic powers.', 'Great Antioxidant & UV protectant\rThe polyphenols in green tea are strong, proven antioxidants. That’s good because they help to protect our skin against not-so-nice little things called free radicals that are out there to destroy the very nice, firming collagen in our skin. Studies show that green tea reduces UV caused skin irritation and reddening (it’s called erythema), and decreases the number of sunburn cells. It’s a great idea to use a green tea product in the morning under your sunscreen.', 'Anticarcinogenic\xa0\rThis one partly comes from the antioxidant and UV protectant properties but we wanted to emphasise that green tea does not only give some “superficial” skin benefits but is truly a health protectant. It can inhibit DNA damage and even activates some enzymes that help with DNA repair. Thanks to this it’s very useful for preventing non-melanoma type skin cancer. So especially if your skin cancer risk factors are high (fair skin, skin cancer history in the family, blue or green eyes, past sunburns, some types of moles), introducing green tea into your skin care is a fantastic thing to do.', 'Anti-inflammatory\rInflammation is an important process that’s a biological, protective response to not nice things that happen to our body. However too much inflammation in our skin is not good: it accelerates the aging process and it’s also behind many skin diseases (acne and rosacea the most common examples). The catechins in green tea are not only amazing antioxidants but they also possess magic anti-inflammatory powers. This makes green tea an awesome choice for sensitive, rosacea or acne prone skin.', 'Anti-microbial\rThis one is probably the least well known, but green tea also shows promising anti-microbial properties against some not-nice bacteria. This property makes green tea even more awesome for acne-prone skin. We could find two promising research paper results showing that 2% green tea lotion is effective to treat mild-to-moderate acne.

It’s the most dominant, and most important molecule in the liquidy stuff between our skin cells (the sciency name for it is the extracellular matrix or ECM). A 70 kg adult has about 15 g of HA in her body, and half of it is in the skin. Most of the skin HA is in the dermis (the deeper layer - about 0.5 mg/kg) but there is also some in the epidermis (the upper layer - about 0.1 mg/kg).', 'Saying it’s a big molecule, doesn’t do it justice. By default, it’s a HUGE molecule. Its molecular weight can be up to 4 million Dalton (that is just the unit molecular weight is measured in). To compare, normal table sugar that you bake with has a molecular weight of 340 Dalton.', 'Because HA is a polymer, its subunits can be repeated many times or just a few times and thus different molecular weight versions exist. There is not a super clear definition what counts as high molecular weight or low molecular weight, but it seems to be roughly like this:', 'HMW-HA in the skin\rFirst, you have to know that this is the version that can mostly be found in our skin. So what does it do?', 'Think of it as a sponge.\xa0HMW-HA has superstar water-binding abilities. It can bind 1000 times its own weight in water. Or to say it another way 1 gram of HA can bind up to 6 liters of water! That is a lot, and this makes HA pretty much the best water-binding ingredient we know today. It is really the sponge of our skin: it’s there in the outer layers\xa0and helps our skin immensely to attract and retain its water content.', ""Not only that, but HA has lots of other\xa0important biological functions. Apart from hydration, the skin-related functions include maintaining the skin's elasticity, reducing the skin's inflammatory response, regenerating the damaged skin barrier and plumping up water-loss related wrinkles. Essentially, helping the skin to look and feel healthy and young."", 'HMW-HA put on your face\rAs for smearing\xa0HMW-HA\xa0all over our face,\xa0you have to know that most probably it does not penetrate the skin. There is a lonely study from 1999 that thinks that HA can absorb into the skin through some active transport mechanism, however, we could not find anything to confirm this.\xa0 What we could find is multiple expert opinions and newer studies that state\xa0HMW-HA is a huge molecule that stays on top of the skin to give surface hydration and to form a protective barrier.', 'Not only that, but it can also work as an ""osmotic pump"", meaning it can be a\xa0penetration enhancer for water-soluble actives.\xa0As the cosmetic chemist at Realize Beauty puts it, HA can be an ""osmotic delivery system\xa0that can push water-soluble actives deeper into the skin by forming a highly hydrated reservoir on the surface of the skin"".', 'LMW-HA in the skin\rThe biological function of LMW-HA in the skin seems to be crazy complicated and different than that of HMW-HA.

One study showed that 0.2% LMW-HA (~ 200kDa used in the study) increases the skin's self-defense and another two studies found LMW-HA (also in 0.2%) to be helpful for inflammation-related skin diseases such as\xa0rosacea and facial seborrheic dermatitis."", 'Third, a manufacturer-related study (done by Evonik)\xa0found that HA versions with a molecular-weight of 50kDa and up do not induce inflammatory signals in the skin, however, the 20kDa version did show some pro-inflammatory activity.

It's known and grown for jojoba oil, the golden yellow liquid coming from the seeds (about 50% of the weight of the seeds will be oil)."", ""At first glance, it seems like your average emollient plant oil: it looks like an oil and it's nourishing and moisturizing to the skin but if we dig a bit deeper, it turns out that jojoba oil is really special and unique: technically - or rather chemically - it's not an oil but a\xa0wax ester (and calling it an oil is kind of sloppy)."", 'So what the heck is a wax ester and why is that important anyway? Well, to understand what a wax ester is, you first have to know that oils are chemically triglycerides:\xa0one glycerin + three fatty acids attached to it. The fatty acids attached to the glycerin vary and thus we have many kinds of oils, but they are all\xa0triglycerides. Mother Nature created triglycerides to be easily hydrolyzed (be\xa0broken down to a glycerin + 3 fatty acid molecules) and oxidized (the fatty acid is broken down into small parts) - this happens basically when we eat fats or oils and our body generates energy from it.', 'Mother Nature also created wax esters but for a totally different purpose. Chemically, a wax ester is a fatty acid + a fatty alcohol, one long molecule. Wax esters are on the outer surface of several plant leaves to give them environmental protection. 25-30% of human sebum is also wax esters to give us\xa0people environmental protection.', 'So being a wax ester results in a couple of unique properties: First, jojoba oil is extremely stable. Like crazy stable. Even if you heat it to 370 C (698 F) for 96 hours, it does not\xa0budge. (Many plant oils tend to go off pretty quickly). If you have some pure jojoba oil at home, you should be fine using it for years.', 'Second, jojoba oil is the most similar to human sebum (both being wax esters), and the two are completely miscible. Acne.org has this not fully proven theory that thanks to this, jojoba might be able to ""trick"" the skin into thinking it has already produced enough sebum, so it might have ""skin balancing"" properties for oily skin.', 'Third, jojoba oil moisturizes the skin through a unique dual action:\xa0on the one hand, it mixes with sebum and forms a thin, non-greasy, semi-occlusive layer; on the other hand, it absorbs into the skin through pores and hair follicles then\xa0diffuses into the intercellular spaces of the outer layer of the skin to make it soft and supple.', 'On balance, the point is this: in contrast to real plant oils, wax esters were designed by Mother Nature to stay on the surface and form\xa0a protective, moisturizing barrier and jojoba oil being a wax ester is uniquely excellent at doing that.']"

Chemically speaking, cosmetic grade mineral oil is a complex mixture of\xa0highly refined saturated hydrocarbons with C15-50 chain length.\xa0It is not merely a ""by-product"" but rather a specifically isolated part of petroleum that is very pure and inert.', 'It is a great emollient and moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity.\xa0Occlusivity is one of the basic mechanisms of how moisturizers work and it means that mineral oil\xa0sits on top of the skin and hinders so-called trans-epidermal water loss, i.e water evaporating out of your skin. When compared to heavy-duty plant oil, extra virgin coconut oil, the two of them were equally efficient and safe as moisturizers in treating xerosis, a skin condition connected to very dry skin.', 'The other thing that mineral oil is really good at is being non-irritating to the skin. The chemical composition of plant oils is more complex with many more possible allergens or irritating\xa0components, while mineral oil is simple, pure\xa0and sensitivity to it is extremely rare.\xa0If you check out the classic French pharmacy brands and their moisturizers for the most sensitive, allergy prone skin, they usually contain\xa0mineral oil. This is no coincidence.', 'The cons of mineral oil\rThe pros of mineral oil\xa0can be interpreted as cons if we look at them from another perspective. Not penetrating the skin but mostly just sitting on top of it and not containing biologically active components, like nice fatty acids and vitamins mean\xa0that mineral oil does not ""nourish"" the skin in the way plant oils do. Mineral oil does\xa0not give the skin any extra goodness, it is simply a non-irritating moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity.', 'The myths around mineral oil\rBadmouthing mineral oil is a favorite sport of many, it is a cheap material and being connected to petrolatum makes it fairly easy to demonize.', 'While it is true that industrial grade mineral oil contains carcinogenic components (so-called\xa0polycyclic compounds), these are completely removed from cosmetic and food grade mineral oil and there is no scientific data showing that the pure, cosmetic grade version is carcinogenic.', 'What is more, in terms of the general health effects of mineral oils used in cosmetics, a 2017\xa0study reviewed the data on their skin penetration and concluded that ""the cosmetic use of mineral oils and waxes does not present a risk to consumers due to a lack of systemic exposure.""', 'Another super common myth surrounding mineral oil is that it is comedogenic. A 2005 study titled\xa0""Is mineral oil comedogenic?"" examined this very question and guess what happened? The study concluded that\xa0 ""based on the animal and human data reported, along with the AAD recommendation, it would appear reasonable to conclude that mineral oil is noncomedogenic in humans.""', 'Overall, we feel that the scaremongering around mineral oil is not justified. For dry and super-sensitive skin types it is a great option. However, if you do not like its origin or its heavy feeling or anything else about it, avoiding it has never been easier.

Reduced amounts of these proteins results in poorer skin structure, reduced skin elasticity, and more wrinkles. Studies show that niacinamide can boost collagen production as well as the production of these three important proteins. That means improved skin structure and fewer wrinkles. FYI, anti-aging studies usually use 4-5% niacinamide daily for 8-12 weeks, so if you are after the anti-aging benefits try to choose a product that tells you the exact percentage of niacinamide it contains.', '#2: Skin-lightening properties: Hyperpigmentation or brown spots are really stubborn and honestly it can be really hard to make them disappear just by topical products. What you can expect for them is to fade a little and niacinamide is a great ingredient to help with that. Studies show that 2-5% niacinamide used daily for 8 weeks results in significant lightening of hyperpigmentation.

First, its molecules are small (228 Da) and very lipophilic (oil loving) and these properties result in very good\xa0absorption. The problem is that you want sunscreens on the top of your skin and not in your bloodstream, so for BP-3 this is a problem. In fact, it absorbs so well that 4 hours after application of a sunscreen product with BP-3,\xa0it can be detected in urine.', 'Another concern of BP-3 is that it shows some estrogenic activity, though it\'s probably not relevant when applied topically to the skin. Estrogenic activity was confirmed only in-vitro (in test tubes) and when taken orally by lab animals, and not when used topically as you would normally. In fact, a 2004 follow-up study to examine the estrogenic effect of sunscreens when used topically on the whole body found that ""the endogenous levels of reproductive hormones were unaffected"" (even though BP-3 could be detected both in plasma and urine, so its absorption is no doubt too good).', 'If that was not enough,\xa0Wikipedia claims that BP-3 is nowadays the\xa0most common allergen found in sunscreens, and the always-trustworthy\xa0smartskincare\xa0writes that ""[benzophenones] have been shown in some studies to promote the\xa0generation of potentially harmful free radicals"".', 'On the up side, sunscreens are pretty well\xa0regulated in several parts of the world, and BP-3 is considered ""safe as used"" and is an allowed sunscreen agent everywhere. It can be used in concentrations of\xa0up to 10% in the EU and up to 6% in the US.', 'Overall, BP-3 is probably our least favorite sunscreen agent and we prefer sunscreens without it. However, if you find a formula that you love and contains BP-3, we do not think that you should throw it away. A sunscreen with BP-3 is definitely better than no sunscreen.']"

So let us see them:', 'The pros of mineral oil\rTrust us, if something is used for more than 100 years in cosmetic\xa0products, it has\xa0advantages. Chemically speaking, cosmetic grade mineral oil is a complex mixture of\xa0highly refined saturated hydrocarbons with C15-50 chain length.\xa0It is not merely a ""by-product"" but rather a specifically isolated part of petroleum that is very pure and inert.', 'It is a great emollient and moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity.\xa0Occlusivity is one of the basic mechanisms of how moisturizers work and it means that mineral oil\xa0sits on top of the skin and hinders so-called trans-epidermal water loss, i.e water evaporating out of your skin. When compared to heavy-duty plant oil, extra virgin coconut oil, the two of them were equally efficient and safe as moisturizers in treating xerosis, a skin condition connected to very dry skin.', 'The other thing that mineral oil is really good at is being non-irritating to the skin. The chemical composition of plant oils is more complex with many more possible allergens or irritating\xa0components, while mineral oil is simple, pure\xa0and sensitivity to it is extremely rare.\xa0If you check out the classic French pharmacy brands and their moisturizers for the most sensitive, allergy prone skin, they usually contain\xa0mineral oil. This is no coincidence.', 'The cons of mineral oil\rThe pros of mineral oil\xa0can be interpreted as cons if we look at them from another perspective. Not penetrating the skin but mostly just sitting on top of it and not containing biologically active components, like nice fatty acids and vitamins mean\xa0that mineral oil does not ""nourish"" the skin in the way plant oils do. Mineral oil does\xa0not give the skin any extra goodness, it is simply a non-irritating moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity.', 'The myths around mineral oil\rBadmouthing mineral oil is a favorite sport of many, it is a cheap material and being connected to petrolatum makes it fairly easy to demonize.', 'While it is true that industrial grade mineral oil contains carcinogenic components (so-called\xa0polycyclic compounds), these are completely removed from cosmetic and food grade mineral oil and there is no scientific data showing that the pure, cosmetic grade version is carcinogenic.', 'What is more, in terms of the general health effects of mineral oils used in cosmetics, a 2017\xa0study reviewed the data on their skin penetration and concluded that ""the cosmetic use of mineral oils and waxes does not present a risk to consumers due to a lack of systemic exposure.""', 'Another super common myth surrounding mineral oil is that it is comedogenic. A 2005 study titled\xa0""Is mineral oil comedogenic?"" examined this very question and guess what happened? The study concluded that\xa0 ""based on the animal and human data reported, along with the AAD recommendation, it would appear reasonable to conclude that mineral oil is noncomedogenic in humans.""', 'Overall, we feel that the scaremongering around mineral oil is not justified. For dry and super-sensitive skin types it is a great option. However, if you do not like its origin or its heavy feeling or anything else about it, avoiding it has never been easier.

Retinol is like a grandkid, it has to be converted (through two steps) in the skin to become retinoic acid. The conversion means retinol is both less effective and less harsh on the skin.', 'So where does our current molecule, Retinal, aka\xa0Retinaldehyde fit into the family (btw, here is a nice visual family tree about who is who)?\xa0 Remember that retinol needed two conversion steps to become retinoic acid? Yes, you are right, Retinal is the intermediate step between\xa0retinoic acid and retinol, meaning it needs only one conversion step to become active in the skin. If we go with our royal family\xa0analogy, Retinal is Prince Charles, directly next in line to the throne.', 'Once retinal is converted, it becomes retinoic acid and does the same things we detailed in our tretinoin description. In a nutshell, it is everything you expect from an anti-aging superstar such as decreased wrinkles, smoother, firmer and more elastic skin.', 'This sounds good, but how does Retinal compare to retinoic acid? Good question! We found a study (a pretty good one with 125 patients) that compared 0.05% retinal with 0.05% retinoic acid (and vehicle).\xa0 They concluded that ""at week 18, a significant reduction of the wrinkle and roughness features was observed with both retinaldehyde and retinoic acid."" and the difference between the two was not statistically significant. (Interestingly, in both groups, the results were less significant at week 44, so\xa0it might be a good idea to have a retinoid break from time to time?) Also, our guy, Retinal was much better tolerated than retinoic acid known for its harshness.', 'The good\xa0tolerability of retinal was also confirmed by another study that compared retinol (ROL), retinal (RAL) and retinoic acid (RA). They found that ""the natural retinoids ROL and RAL do have a good tolerance profile, in contrast with the irritating potential of RA"", meaning retinal is an awesome alternative if you have irritation and flaking issues with prescription products, such as Retin-A.', 'Last, but not least, we want to mention a pretty big (but subjectively evaluated), Avene (the French pharmacy brand famous for its Retinal products) sponsored study that examined the tolerability and efficacy of a 0.1 Retinal + 6% glycolic acid product in the treatment\xa0of acne. The product was added next to the standard anti-acne regimen of\xa01,709 patients for 90 days and the study concluded that the formula was both very well tolerated as well as effective next to other standard anti-acne medications such as benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics.', 'Overall, if you are into retinoids, Retinal is a really awesome and well-proven member of the family that is absolutely worth trying.']"

It compared\xa00.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0% retinol with the commonly available tretinoin concentrations (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%). The authors of the study concluded that ""results from this comparison study suggest that this sustained-release retinol complex containing multiple agents for optimal irritation control provides comparable improvements to tretinoin in the appearance of photo damage.""', 'A third study that we think is interesting and worth mentioning is one that did not try to determine what concentration of retinol is similar to what concentration of retinoic acid, but went the other way and compared the effects of equal concentrations (0.1%) of retinol and retinoic acid. The result of this study was that\xa0""topical retinol treatment induces similar changes in skin histology and skin related gene and protein expression as seen with retinoic acid application, and the magnitude is more than half of that from retinoic acid treatment"".', 'Of course, not only the anti-aging effects\xa0but the side effects (like irritation, skin flaking, dryness, redness)\xa0 are also milder with retinol. A mild retinol product (around 0.1%) is still proven effective and very tolerable.

However, after 48 weeks, the 0.15% RP worked wonders for\xa0actinic keratoses, a rough, scaly patch caused by UV damage (its name contains actinic, but it is not acne, has nothing to do with it (!)).', 'So, it seems that the minimum effective dose of\xa0Retinyl Propionate is larger than 0.15% which is not surprising given that it has to do three conversion steps to reach the active form, retinoic acid. But 0.3% RP (or more, obvs) seems to be an effective dose, and even though the proof is not as solid as it is for retinol itself, if you are looking for a more gentle alternative, or if you are in the mood for experimentation,\xa0Retinyl Propionate looks like a noteworthy alternative and the most promising option among retinol esters.']"

According to a 2012 study on a serum\xa0containing barley bioengineered epidermal growth factor, ""clinical evaluations showed statistically significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and rhytids, skin texture, pore size, and various dyschromatic conditions apparent within the first month of use, and continuing improvement trends for the duration of the study"" (which was 3 months).', 'This all sounds amazing, ""give me some EGF Serum"", we can hear you say! But as we wrote in the intro, the topic is complex and controversial so here are some of the questions that keep coming up around slathering EGF all over our face.', 'The first and biggest concern is that if EGF is so good at stimulating cell proliferation, how does it relate to cancer? Is\xa0the definition of cancer not ""cells proliferating out of control""?\xa0 Most experts agree on this answer: EGF is\xa0mitogenic (= stimulates cell proliferation) but not\xa0mutagenic (= does not alter the cell to make it cancerous).\xa0If you do not have cancer, you will not get cancer from EGF. However, if you have cancerous cells, EGF will help them to spread, just like it helps healthy cells. So if you have a lot of moles, excessive UV exposure in the past, or if you have any of the skin cancer risk factors, we suggest you should think twice about using EGF products.\xa0The same is true if you have psoriasis, a skin disease related to the abnormal growth of epidermal skin cells. You do not want to add fuel to the fire\xa0with EGF.', 'Other (less serious)\xa0concerns\xa0are if EGF can properly penetrate the skin (as it is a medium-sized, polar molecule, so a special delivery\xa0system is probably needed), if it can affect\xa0collagen synthesis (or just works on the surface plumping up only the upmost layers of the skin) and if it has beneficial effects at all when used in isolation versus when used in a ""conditioned media"" that contains lots of growth factors resembling the synergistic balance found in the skin.', 'Overall, our impression is that EGF is definitely a potent molecule. Some EGF products have a cult-like following\xa0adding anecdotal evidence to the clinical studies showing EGF has a beneficial effect on the skin. If you like experimenting, by all means,\xa0go ahead (unless you have psoriasis or high skin cancer risk factors), but if you are a better safe than sorry type, stick to daily SPF + a good retinoid product.

Next to benzoyl peroxide, it’s the gold standard ingredient for treating problem skin.', 'There are two reasons for this:', 'Reason #1: It can exfoliate skin both on the surface and in the poresAHAs are very cool, but they are water soluble and cannot go into the pores. SA is lipid soluble and it can go right into the pores and shed the stuck, dead skin cells out from there. That’s really good for treating blackheads as well as preventing acne formation.', 'This was confirmed also by a study that compared 8% AHA and 2% BHA for treating blackheads. AHA did not decrease the blackhead density statistically significantly, but BHA did.', 'Reason #2: SA is a potent anti-inflammatory\rThe chemical structure of SA is very similar to aspirin, and it does have similar anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory effect. That is helpful both for acne and rosacea.', 'So SA is definitely an ingredient to try if you have oily or problem skin, but all in all, it’s more effective against blackheads than inflamed zits. For the latter one, \xa0it’s only moderately effective, and benzoyl peroxide outperforms it by leaps and bounds. But they work in different ways, so a combination therapy is a great way to fight (and win) against acne.

In fact, in the EU 2% is the maximum strength allowed in at home products.', 'There are also professional BHA peels that go in the 20-30% range. Those can fade pigmentation, decrease surface roughness, reduce fine lines and of course, treat acne.', 'Regarding pH requirements for BHA, unlike for AHAs where\xa0an acidic pH is super important for efficacy, it might be less relevant for BHA.', 'Oh, and one more things: studies show that SA (at 2%) does not increase skin’s sun sensitivity, but it has photoprotective effects.

Well, to understand what a wax ester is, you first have to know that oils are chemically triglycerides:\xa0one glycerin + three fatty acids attached to it. The fatty acids attached to the glycerin vary and thus we have many kinds of oils, but they are all\xa0triglycerides. Mother Nature created triglycerides to be easily hydrolyzed (be\xa0broken down to a glycerin + 3 fatty acid molecules) and oxidized (the fatty acid is broken down into small parts) - this happens basically when we eat fats or oils and our body generates energy from it.', 'Mother Nature also created wax esters but for a totally different purpose. Chemically, a wax ester is a fatty acid + a fatty alcohol, one long molecule. Wax esters are on the outer surface of several plant leaves to give them environmental protection. 25-30% of human sebum is also wax esters to give us\xa0people environmental protection.', 'So being a wax ester results in a couple of unique properties: First, jojoba oil is extremely stable. Like crazy stable. Even if you heat it to 370 C (698 F) for 96 hours, it does not\xa0budge. (Many plant oils tend to go off pretty quickly). If you have some pure jojoba oil at home, you should be fine using it for years.', 'Second, jojoba oil is the most similar to human sebum (both being wax esters), and the two are completely miscible. Acne.org has this not fully proven theory that thanks to this, jojoba might be able to ""trick"" the skin into thinking it has already produced enough sebum, so it might have ""skin balancing"" properties for oily skin.', 'Third, jojoba oil moisturizes the skin through a unique dual action:\xa0on the one hand, it mixes with sebum and forms a thin, non-greasy, semi-occlusive layer; on the other hand, it absorbs into the skin through pores and hair follicles then\xa0diffuses into the intercellular spaces of the outer layer of the skin to make it soft and supple.', 'On balance, the point is this: in contrast to real plant oils, wax esters were designed by Mother Nature to stay on the surface and form\xa0a protective, moisturizing barrier and jojoba oil being a wax ester is uniquely excellent at doing that.']"

As cosmetic chemist kindofstephen\xa0writes on reddit\xa0 ""sodium hyaluronate disassociates into hyaluronic acid molecule and a sodium atom in solution"".', 'In spite of this, if you search for ""hyaluronic acid vs sodium hyaluronate"" you will find on multiple places that sodium hyaluronate is smaller and can penetrate the skin better. Chemically, this is definitely not true, as the two forms are almost the same, both are polymers and the subunits can be repeated in both forms as much as you like. (We also checked\xa0Prospector for sodium hyaluronate versions actually used in cosmetic products and found that the most common molecular weight was 1.5-1.8 million Da that absolutely counts as high molecular weight).', 'What seems to be a true difference, though, is that the salt form is more stable, easier to formulate and\xa0cheaper so it pops up more often on the ingredient lists.', 'If you wanna become a real HA-and-the-skin expert you can read way more about the topic at hyaluronic acid\xa0(including penetration-questions, differences between high and low molecular weight versions and a bunch of references to scientific literature).']"

This water filled crosslinked HA gel forms a smooth film on the skin and continuously delivers the bound water, so it gives long-term moisturizing benefits.', ""Btw, crosslinking HA was developed for dermal fillers (as crosslinking helps their longevity), and this guy is the topical version of FDA approved dermal filler called\xa0Hylan B gel. Smearing crosslinked version all over ourselves\xa0is a newish thing, and incoming evidence so far suggests that it's a great idea, even better than normal HA."", 'A very recent, 2016 research article compared the topical moisturizing effect of crosslinked HA (not Hylan B gel specifically, but something called Resilient HA or RHA), HMW-HA and LMW-HA and found that ""TEWL (that is trans-epidermal water loss, the water that evaporates from the skin) was reduced by 27.8% with RHA, and by 15.6% with HMW HA, but increased by 55.5% with LMW HA.""

It is derived from the seeds of\xa0Psoralea Corylifolia, aka Babchi,\xa0a\xa0plant important in Indian and Chinese medicine. The molecule was first isolated in 1973 and several anti-something properties are known about it: it has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial\xa0and hepatoprotective magical abilities like plenty of other Ayurvedic plant extracts.', 'What makes\xa0Bakuchiol a special snowflake\xa0is the recent discovery that it behaves on the skin in a way very similar to well-known skincare superstar, retinol. While chemically, it has nothing to do with the vitamin-A family, aka retinoids, comparative gene expression profiling (a fancy way of saying that they compared how retinol and bakuchiol modify the way \xa0skin cells behave\xa0and produce\xa0important skin proteins such as collagen) shows that retinol and bakuchiol regulate skin cell behavior in a similar way.', 'To be more specific, both Bakuchiol and retinol upregulate\xa0collagen I, III and IV production and downregulate\xa0MMP, the evil collagen attacking\xa0enzyme in our skin. This means more collagen stays in our skin and we all know that more collagen equals firmer, more wrinkle-free skin.\xa0 A 12-week\xa0clinical study using a 0.5% Bakuchiol formula with 17 people using it twice a day confirmed a significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, elasticity, firmness and an overall reduction in photo-damage. Also, the test formula was very well tolerated, without any retinol-like side effects.', 'What\'s more, a 2018 double-blind\xa0study with 44 people compared 0.5% Bakuchiol with 0.5% retinol cream and found that ""bakuchiol is comparable to retinol in its ability to improve photoaging\xa0and is better tolerated than retinol"". A super promising result after 12 weeks.', ""If you are not a daredevil-type who doesn't want to stop using a super well-proven retinol for a newbie like Bakuchiol, we have good news. The two also work\xa0very nicely together and Bakuchiol can actually help to\xa0stabilize the otherwise unstable and hard to formulate retinol."", 'And we are still not done, as Bakuchiol shows not only anti-aging properties but also nice anti-acne\xa0effects. 1% Bakuchiol seems to be very effective in itself (57% reduction in acne after 6 weeks treatment) and even better when combined with 2% salicylic acid\xa0(67% reduction in acne after 6 weeks). We like that Bakuchiol is such a good team player!\xa0 The molecule works against acne in multiple ways: It downregulates 5α-reductase (a\xa0sebum-controlling enzyme), it is antibacterial (including P. acnes), anti-inflammatory and it inhibits lipid-peroxidation, an evil oxidative process that is recently thought to be a very early trigger in the acne process.', 'We feel that this description is becoming very long so we will just mention that Bakuchiol also seems to positively regulate hydration-related genes such as Aquaporin 3 and also shows some melanin-inhibiting properties.', 'Overall, we think Bakuchiol is an awesome\xa0molecule with lots of promise both for anti-aging and anti-acne. But the proof compared to the well-established superstars is far from solid, so in a skincare routine, we would rather add Bakuchiol next to retinol than straight up replace it.

Retinoic acid is a kind of\xa0synonym for tretinoin, or to be exact all-trans-retinoic-acids\xa0are exactly the same as tretinoin. FYI, tretinoin is a naturally occurring thing and can be found in good quality rosehip oil.', 'A little history\rRetinoids are not something new and the intense research into them started quite a while ago. In 1931 Paul Karrer won the Nobel prize\xa0for figuring out the structure of vitamin A. Twelve years later, retinol was successfully synthesized and since then, vitamin A derivatives started to pop up.', 'Tretinoin itself was developed in the late 1960s by two guys named James Fulton\xa0and\xa0Albert Kligman. It was originally intended to treat acne but acne patients in the clinical trials started to report smoother and less wrinkled skin so the\xa0research\xa0into its anti-aging benefits\xa0soon began. It went so well, that the data was submitted to the FDA (the authority that approves drugs in the US) and it\xa0approved tretinoin for ""use\xa0against photo damage"". Even today, tretinoin is the only thing approved by the FDA in the topical anti-aging field, so it\'s a really big deal.', 'All-around magic for skin health\rDr. Leslie Baumann writes in her great Cosmetic Dermatology book that ""there are more than 125 distinct dermatologic disorders\xa0for which there is credible evidence of retinoid efficacy"". Don\'t worry, we will not list out all of them, but if you have one (or more) of the common skin problems (like wrinkles, loss of firmness, dull skin, acne or hyperpigmentation), retinoids will improve this.', 'The reason why retinoids, especially tretinoin, are such an all-around skin problem solver is that they\xa0work on the skin at a cellular level and they\xa0make\xa0your skin cells behave in a healthy and normal way. Our skin cells contain\xa0retinoic acid receptors and tretinoin binds directly to these receptors and changes basic cell behaviour, like gene expression.', ""Anti-aging effects in more details\rWhen it comes to skin aging, collagen plays a big role. It acts like tent poles\xa0that make sure the tent fabric is nice and firm. Adding collagen to the skin from your serums/moisturizers does not work, though. It's like\xa0throwing poles at a ramshackle tent on the ground and hoping that the poles will magically fall into the right place and erect the tent, it simply does not work that way."", ""You can do two other things: one is to preserve the existing collagen in your skin as much as possible and the other is to convince the skin to create some more. The former will prevent wrinkles and loss of firmness, the latter has a chance to repair some of the existing damage. Tretinoin is great because it works in both ways. It inhibits collagen-destroying\xa0 enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases\xa0(MMPs, that are increased by UVB) and it's also proven to boost the skins own collagen synthesis."", ""If that wasn't enough, tretinoin also helps aging skin in a bunch of other ways: it stimulates\xa0not only collagen (type I and III), but\xa0other important\xa0skin elements as well, e.g. natural moisturizing factor glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), or the skin protein, filaggrin. It also makes the epidermis thicker\xa0and compacts the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum."", 'The net result of all the things tretinoin does is less wrinkled, firmer, smoother and tighter skin. Simply put, pretty much everything you could want from an anti-aging ingredient.', 'Other things tretinoin can help with\rWe have already written that tretinoin was originally developed to treat acne, and it does. It normalizes keratinization meaning that it prevents dead skin cells from sticking together and clogging the pores. Not only that, but it also makes your pores produce less sebum that helps the pores to stay nice and clean and not get clogged up by an excess sebum and dead skin cells.', 'Another notable benefit of tretinoin is skin lightening. It works by both preventing clumping of melanin in basal cells (skin cells at the bottom of the epidermis) and by accelerating epidermal turnover and so the loss of melanin. However, the skin lightening effect is not as strong as the gold-standard hydroquinone. In Tri-Luma cream, a prescription treatment for melasma, tretinoin,\xa0hydroquinone and a mild steroid are all combined to achieve clinical results.', ""What's the catch (aka side effects)\rWe often wonder why medicines, just like life, work in such a tricky way that the bigger positive effects almost always come with bigger negative side effects. This is definitely true for tretinoin and younger looking skin does not come without side effects."", 'The most common ones are irritation, skin flaking and redness.

It is the ingredient everyone keeps talking\xa0about and there is a reason for that: it is the most\xa0proven anti-aging superstar available over the counter.', 'If you want to dig a bit deeper and really\xa0understand retinol, you have to start with tretinoin. We have written a nice geeky description about it, so click here, and read all about it.', ""So now you know that tretinoin, or retinoic acid, as it's often called, is the real, proven, FDA-approved anti-aging magic ingredient and tretinoin and retinol are both retinoids. They are not exactly the same, but\xa0they belong to the same family. With that in mind,\xa0we will focus here on the differences, and on how the anti-aging effect of retinol measures up against the anti-aging effect of tretinoin."", 'Tretinoin is so damn effective because our skin cells have so-called retinoid receptors that interact directly with tretinoin but they cannot interact with retinol. Retinol itself is not active, and it has to be converted to retinoic acid to actually do something.', 'In theory, our skin has metabolic machinery to do the conversion which is a two-step process: retinol -- > retinaldehyde --> retinoic acid.', ""Once the conversion is complete, retinol becomes tretinoin and can do the same thing as we have detailed in our tretinoin\xa0description\xa0BUT\xa0this two-step conversion process is not very effective and the effectiveness varies from person to person. This means that\xa0retinol is much weaker than tretinoin, and it's also possible that retinol doesn't do much for you, because your skin is a lazy converter, while tretinoin still happily works."", ""So retinol (in theory) becomes retinoic acid in the skin and from there it can work it's\xa0tretinoin-magic. There are several studies proving that retinol does exhibit\xa0biological activity and causes similar changes to the\xa0skin than tretinoin (0.1% retinol concentration gives already nice results) but the question is more the extent of the effects. Luckily there are a few studies to give us an idea."", 'A study from 1997 compared the penetration and the effectiveness of retinol and retinoic acid and found that retinol penetrates better and ""retinol at 0.25% may be a useful retinoid for application without occlusion because it does not irritate but does induce cellular and molecular changes similar to those observed with application of 0.025% retinoic acid.""', 'Another 2015\xa0study confirms the ballpark number\xa0that retinol is about 10 times less potent than tretinoin. It compared\xa00.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0% retinol with the commonly available tretinoin concentrations (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%). The authors of the study concluded that ""results from this comparison study suggest that this sustained-release retinol complex containing multiple agents for optimal irritation control provides comparable improvements to tretinoin in the appearance of photo damage.""', 'A third study that we think is interesting and worth mentioning is one that did not try to determine what concentration of retinol is similar to what concentration of retinoic acid, but went the other way and compared the effects of equal concentrations (0.1%) of retinol and retinoic acid. The result of this study was that\xa0""topical retinol treatment induces similar changes in skin histology and skin related gene and protein expression as seen with retinoic acid application, and the magnitude is more than half of that from retinoic acid treatment"".', 'Of course, not only the anti-aging effects\xa0but the side effects (like irritation, skin flaking, dryness, redness)\xa0 are also milder with retinol. A mild retinol product (around 0.1%) is still proven effective and very tolerable. You have to be more careful (introduce it gradually!) with stronger versions (around 1% retinol) where both the effects and the side effects can come close to that of tretinoin.', ""Bottom line: Retinol is not the same as retinoic acid\xa0or tretinoin. It's\xa0less potent but still works great.

Serious performance, A-list superstar but at the same time shows some major divaish behaviour.', 'But before we dive into it let’s just take a quick look where Vit C comes from. By the 18th century sailors noticed that if they eat plenty of citrus fruits that helps to prevent scurvy (an ugly disease that causes bleeding gums and other bad things - caused by Vit C deficiency). At that time they had no clue what it was inside citrus fruits that helped. Scientists managed to figure out only in the 1930s what Vitamin C is.', 'Since then it’s been a much researched, lovely vitamin that has turned out to have tremendous health benefits not only for our body but also for our skin. It’s the primary water-soluble antioxidant in our tissue and plays a big role in the complicated process where our skin creates some nice new skin-firming collagen.', 'So it’s really good to have plenty of Vit C in our body and in our skin but the trick is that our body cannot make it for itself (fun fact: some animals, like mice can!). We have to take it entirely from outside sources. Citrus fruits, black currants, red pepper or guava are for example awesome Vit C rich foods that you should eat regularly.', 'And here is an another trick: eating Vit C does not help our skin to have high levels of it. And of course when the sun shines upon us or when we face environmental pollution that is also not good for the Vit C levels in our skin.', 'But here is good news: putting some lovely Vit C cream or serum on our skin actually helps. So how does it help exactly? Let’s see:', 'Multiple studies showed that animal skin treated with topical ascorbic acid have less skin reddening (it’s called erythema), fewer sunburn cells, and decreased tumor formation after UV exposure.', 'What this means is that it’ a great idea to use your Vit C serum in the morning under your sunscreen (not instead of it!). \xa0For even better protection choose a serum that contains Vit E as well as it doubles the photoprotection properties of Vit C. And wait, it gets even better: Ferulic acid further doubles the photoprotection of Vit C + E.', 'So this trio, Vit C + E + Ferulic acid is really effective. If you are into protecting your skin from UV rays (and you should be if you want lovely skin for a long time) you should try a serum containing the magic trio. (BTW, this was discovered by American researcher, Sheldon Pinnell in 2005 and Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Serum was the first one on the market containing all three actives.)', 'Collagen is complicated but the most important thing to know about it is that it’s like tent pole. It helps to keep our skin firm and wrinkle free. Throwing poles on a ramshackle tent does not help. The poles do not go magically to the right place to make the tent nice and firm again. It’s the same with collagen - in a skincare product it does not really help (to be fair it has some hydrating properties, but not wrinkle erasing magic properties).', 'Boosting the collagen production of your skin helps. And Vit C can do that. In a study from 1999 a 10% Vit C serum (Cellex-C) was shown to decrease wrinkles when applied for a 3 month period. A few years later another study using a 5% Vit C cream for a 6 month period showed statistically significant improvement in skin hydration, wrinkles, glare, brown spots and skin density.', 'Helping your skin to make extra collagen is always nice and Vit C is one of the very very few ingredients that is proved to do so in peer reviewed studies. A-list superstar, right?', 'Brown spots or hyperpigmentation is just not nice and frankly it is very difficult to fade them just with skincare. But Vit C can help. For brown spots to form the body needs an enzyme (stuffs that help chemical reactions in our body) called tyrosinase. Vit C works by inhibiting this enzyme so brown spots cannot form that effectively.', 'That is all nice and lovely, and an A-list superstar performance. But we have started our description saying that Vit C is such a diva. So what about that? Well, here are its major diva demands:', 'If you ever tried a pure Vit C serum and you have not used it up in a month or two then you must have noticed that it changed its color and started to become brownish. Yes, that was the Vit C going wrong in the product.', 'There are some tips and tricks that help to stabilize Vit C. Low pH (below 3.5pH) or waterless formulation helps. Also some other ingredients help, like ferulic acid, glutathione, citric acid or sodium metabisulfite. These are all shown in research studies to help with the stability issues. Also protecting the formula from air and light is super important. The best is a totally airless packaging when it comes to Vit C formulas.', 'But even with all these tricks employed a potent Vit C serum can be used usually only three month after opening it. Diva, see?', 'It is water soluble and skin is just not attracted to water soluble things but rather to oil soluble things. So this makes it a little tricky for Vit C to actually get into your skin. But good news: low pH (again below 3.5pH) solves the problem, so look out for water based Vit C serums that state that they have the right pH or waterless formulas can work too.', 'Slight tingling is quite normal but if your skin is super sensitive, rosacea prone than a very potent (above 10%) Vit C serum might not be for you. You know, if there are some big advantages there will always be some disadvantages too. That’s just how it is.

It is odorless and has a salty, bitter taste. It can be found in meat, fish, wheat and small\xa0amounts in vegetables. The version used in cosmetics is\xa0produced exclusively synthetically."", ""Let's look at all those skin benefits:"", '#1: Anti-aging, wrinkle-smoothing properties: With age, our skin tends to\xa0slow down in many ways. One of them is in producing important proteins, such as keratin, filaggrin, and involucrin, at a slower rate. Reduced amounts of these proteins results in poorer skin structure, reduced skin elasticity, and more wrinkles. Studies show that niacinamide can boost collagen production as well as the production of these three important proteins. That means improved skin structure and fewer wrinkles. FYI, anti-aging studies usually use 4-5% niacinamide daily for 8-12 weeks, so if you are after the anti-aging benefits try to choose a product that tells you the exact percentage of niacinamide it contains.', '#2: Skin-lightening properties: Hyperpigmentation or brown spots are really stubborn and honestly it can be really hard to make them disappear just by topical products. What you can expect for them is to fade a little and niacinamide is a great ingredient to help with that. Studies show that 2-5% niacinamide used daily for 8 weeks results in significant lightening of hyperpigmentation. When combined with amino sugar, acetyl glucosamine the results are even better.', ""What's more, niacinamide as a skin lightener works in a way different to most others. It suppresses the transfer of melanosomes (little spheres carrying the melanin pigment) from melanocytes (skin cells producing the melanin) to keratinocytes (skin cells in the top layer\xa0of the skin) while most other skin lighteners block an enzyme called tyrosinase (that plays an important role in melanin production). So if you want to mount a multi-front attack on the brown spots you can combine a niacinamide treatment with tyrosinase inhibitors like vitamin C, arbutin or kojic acid."", '#3: Barrier repair functions: the skin barrier is the outer layer of the skin that is amazingly important at keeping the skin hydrated and healthy. The stuff between the skin cells consists mainly of free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides. The amount and structure of these\xa0determine how healthy the skin barrier is. What studies have shown is that 2% niacinamide can increase the synthesis of free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides\xa0that result in healthier and stronger skin barrier, decreased trans-epidermal water loss and better hydrated skin.', ""#4: Anti-acne properties: though niacinamide does not count as one of the gold standard anti-acne ingredients, if you have problem skin it's totally worth a try. It has sebum regulating and anti-inflammatory properties and a study that used 4% niacinamide for 8 weeks to treat acne found that 82% of those treated showed some improvement. What's more, the results were\xa0slightly better than with a 1% clindamycin gel, an antibiotics often used to treat acne."", '#5: Other notable things: if the above four things are not \xa0enough to convince you about niacinamide here are some more reasons! :) \xa0Studies show that vitamin B3 can help to speed up epidermal cell growth (that slows down with age), it can help with wound healing, it can smooth the structure of the skin and it has also antibacterial and photo protective properties. Plus, it might also be useful for rosacea and atopic dermatitis probably because of its anti-inflammatory property.', 'Well, that was long. Hope we could convince you that niacinamide is a skincare superstar and a must-try for pretty much everybody. :)']"

It works by inhibiting the\xa0MITF gene that plays an important role in controlling melanin producing skin cells called melanocytes.', 'In the in-vivo (made on real people) test of the manufacturer, 23 Asian volunteers used a 5%\xa0ß-White formula for 56 days twice a day and 87% reported a more uniform skin tone and 91% felt that their skin was brighter than before.', 'As for research, we found one study from 2016 that combined\xa0Oligopeptide-68 with sunscreen and another skin-lightening active called\xa0Diacetyl Boldine (DAB). The conclusion was that ""combination of DAB serum at night and DAB/TGF-β1 biomimetic oligopeptide-68/sunscreen cream in the morning and at noon was effective and safe for facial melasma. They were superior to HQ\xa0in pigment reduction."" \xa0HQ refers to the famous\xa0Hydroquinone that\'s the gold-standard skin-lightening\xa0ingredient, so having comparable or superior results is a very promising outcome.', 'Overall, if you are into skin-lightening or fading pigmentation spots, Oligopeptide-68 might be something to try.']"
