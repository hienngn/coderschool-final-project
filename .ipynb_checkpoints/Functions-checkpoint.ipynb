The clear oily liquid that is the \"cheap by-product\" of refining crude oil and the one that gets a lot of heat for its poor provenance. It is a very controversial ingredient with pros and cons and plenty of myths\\\\xa0around it. So let us see them:\\', \\'The pros of mineral oil\\\\rTrust us, if something is used for more than 100 years in cosmetic\\\\xa0products, it has\\\\xa0advantages. Chemically speaking, cosmetic grade mineral oil is a complex mixture of\\\\xa0highly refined saturated hydrocarbons with C15-50 chain length.\\\\xa0It is not merely a \"by-product\" but rather a specifically isolated part of petroleum that is very pure and inert.\\', \\'It is a great emollient and moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity.\\\\xa0Occlusivity is one of the basic mechanisms of how moisturizers work and it means that mineral oil\\\\xa0sits on top of the skin and hinders so-called trans-epidermal water loss, i.e water evaporating out of your skin. When compared to heavy-duty plant oil, extra virgin coconut oil, the two of them were equally efficient and safe as moisturizers in treating xerosis, a skin condition connected to very dry skin.\\', \\'The other thing that mineral oil is really good at is being non-irritating to the skin. The chemical composition of plant oils is more complex with many more possible allergens or irritating\\\\xa0components, while mineral oil is simple, pure\\\\xa0and sensitivity to it is extremely rare.\\\\xa0If you check out the classic French pharmacy brands and their moisturizers for the most sensitive, allergy prone skin, they usually contain\\\\xa0mineral oil. This is no coincidence.\\', \\'The cons of mineral oil\\\\rThe pros of mineral oil\\\\xa0can be interpreted as cons if we look at them from another perspective. Not penetrating the skin but mostly just sitting on top of it and not containing biologically active components, like nice fatty acids and vitamins mean\\\\xa0that mineral oil does not \"nourish\" the skin in the way plant oils do. Mineral oil does\\\\xa0not give the skin any extra goodness, it is simply a non-irritating moisturizer working mainly by occlusivity.\\', \\'The myths around mineral oil\\\\rBadmouthing mineral oil is a favorite sport of many, it is a cheap material and being connected to petrolatum makes it fairly easy to demonize.\\', \\'While it is true that industrial grade mineral oil contains carcinogenic components (so-called\\\\xa0polycyclic compounds), these are completely removed from cosmetic and food grade mineral oil and there is no scientific data showing that the pure, cosmetic grade version is carcinogenic.\\', \\'What is more, in terms of the general health effects of mineral oils used in cosmetics, a 2017\\\\xa0study reviewed the data on their skin penetration and concluded that \"the cosmetic use of mineral oils and waxes does not present a risk to consumers due to a lack of systemic exposure.\"\\', \\'Another super common myth surrounding mineral oil is that it is comedogenic. A 2005 study titled\\\\xa0\"Is mineral oil comedogenic?\" examined this very question and guess what happened? The study concluded that\\\\xa0 \"based on the animal and human data reported, along with the AAD recommendation, it would appear reasonable to conclude that mineral oil is noncomedogenic in humans.\"\\', \\'Overall, we feel that the scaremongering around mineral oil is not justified. For dry and super-sensitive skin types it is a great option. However, if you do not like its origin or its heavy feeling or anything else about it, avoiding it has never been easier. Mineral oil has such a bad reputation nowadays that cosmetic companies hardly dare to use it anymore.\\']'],\n",

But before we go into the details, let\\'s just quickly define what the heck ceramides are:\", \\'They are waxy lipids that can be found naturally in the outer layer of the skin (called stratum corneum - SC). And they are there in big amounts! The goopy stuff between our skin cells is called extracellular matrix that consists mainly of lipids. And ceramides are about 50% of those lipids (the other important ones are cholesterol with 25% and fatty acids with 15%).\\', \\'Ok, so now we know what ceramides are, let\\\\\\'s see what they do in our skin: research shows clearly that they play a super important role in keeping the skin barrier healthy and the skin hydrated. If ceramides in the skin are decreased, more water can evaporate from the skin and there is less water remaining in the skin. So ceramides form kind of a \"water-proof\" protecting layer\\\\xa0and make sure that our skin remains nice and hydrated.\\', \\'Now the question is only this: If we put ceramides all over our face do they\\\\xa0work as well as ceramides already naturally in our skin?

       "  '[\\'Hyaluronic acid (HA) and its various forms are the current IT-moisturizers. So let’s see, what is hyaluronic acid and even more importantly what’s the big deal about it?\\', \\'HA is a nice big sugar molecule\\\\xa0from repeated subunits (polymer) that can be found naturally in our body. It’s the most dominant, and most important molecule in the liquidy stuff between our skin cells (the sciency name for it is the extracellular matrix or ECM). A 70 kg adult has about 15 g of HA in her body, and half of it is in the skin. Most of the skin HA is in the dermis (the deeper layer - about 0.5 mg/kg) but there is also some in the epidermis (the upper layer - about 0.1 mg/kg).\\', \\'Saying it’s a big molecule, doesn’t do it justice. By default, it’s a HUGE molecule. Its molecular weight can be up to 4 million Dalton (that is just the unit molecular weight is measured in). To compare, normal table sugar that you bake with has a molecular weight of 340 Dalton.\\', \\'Because HA is a polymer, its subunits can be repeated many times or just a few times and thus different molecular weight versions exist. There is not a super clear definition what counts as high molecular weight or low molecular weight, but it seems to be roughly like this:\\', \\'HMW-HA in the skin\\\\rFirst, you have to know that this is the version that can mostly be found in our skin. So what does it do?\\', \\'Think of it as a sponge.\\\\xa0HMW-HA has superstar water-binding abilities. It can bind 1000 times its own weight in water. Or to say it another way 1 gram of HA can bind up to 6 liters of water! That is a lot, and this makes HA pretty much the best water-binding ingredient we know today. It is really the sponge of our skin: it’s there in the outer layers\\\\xa0and helps our skin immensely to attract and retain its water content.\\', \"Not only that, but HA has lots of other\\\\xa0important biological functions. Apart from hydration, the skin-related functions include maintaining the skin\\'s elasticity, reducing the skin\\'s inflammatory response, regenerating the damaged skin barrier and plumping up water-loss related wrinkles. Essentially, helping the skin to look and feel healthy and young.\", \\'HMW-HA put on your face\\\\rAs for smearing\\\\xa0HMW-HA\\\\xa0all over our face,\\\\xa0you have to know that most probably it does not penetrate the skin. There is a lonely study from 1999 that thinks that HA can absorb into the skin through some active transport mechanism, however, we could not find anything to confirm this.\\\\xa0 What we could find is multiple expert opinions and newer studies that state\\\\xa0HMW-HA is a huge molecule that stays on top of the skin to give surface hydration and to form a protective barrier.\\', \\'Not only that, but it can also work as an \"osmotic pump\", meaning it can be a\\\\xa0penetration enhancer for water-soluble actives.\\\\xa0As the cosmetic chemist at Realize Beauty puts it, HA can be an \"osmotic delivery system\\\\xa0that can push water-soluble actives deeper into the skin by forming a highly hydrated reservoir on the surface of the skin\".\\', \\'LMW-HA in the skin\\\\rThe biological function of LMW-HA in the skin seems to be crazy complicated and different than that of HMW-HA. LMW-HA is mostly created when HMW-HA is chopped up into smaller pieces at sites of an injury and it is thought to be a\\\\xa0pro-inflammatory signal molecule that says \"danger, danger, bring on some inflammation and repair yourself\".\\', \"LMW-HA put on your face\\\\rBased on LMW-HA\\'s biological role, the question is logical: is LMW-HA pro-inflammatory when we smear it on? Well, it is a good question and we do not have the surefire answer. Most evidence points so far to a no, at least when it comes to molecular weights in the 50kDa and up range.\", \\'First, LMW-HA is still a big-big molecule whose penetration is questionable. It might absorb a bit better than HMW-HA, but that still means working mostly in the epidermis, the uppermost layers of the skin.\\', \"Second, we found multiple studies showing that LMW-HA\\\\xa0can\\\\xa0help the skin to repair itself. One study showed that 0.2% LMW-HA (~ 200kDa used in the study) increases the skin\\'s self-defense and another two studies found LMW-HA (also in 0.2%) to be helpful for inflammation-related skin diseases such as\\\\xa0rosacea and facial seborrheic dermatitis.\", \\'Third, a manufacturer-related study (done by Evonik)\\\\xa0found that HA versions with a molecular-weight of 50kDa and up do not induce inflammatory signals in the skin, however, the 20kDa version did show some pro-inflammatory activity. Granted, this was done on reconstituted human epidermis, so it might or might not be like this on real human skin. BTW, they also found in-vivo (on real people) that the LMW-HA versions, especially the one with 50kDa MW can plump up wrinkles really good.\\', \"So based on LMW-HA\\'s biological role and the Evonik study, you might want to be careful with ultra-low molecular weights, the ones below 50kDa. However, this is also not a sure\\\\xa0thing. We also saw manufacturer data showing that a 10kDa molecular weight HA version has better antioxidant activity than a 1.6MDa version and it also had better sun protection and after-sun repair abilities than the higher MW versions.\", \\'We really cannot tell you the surefire answer. Our best guess is that if you\\\\xa0are a cautious type, avoid the ultra-low MW versions, but \"normal\" LMW-HA seems to be all OK\\\\xa0to us.\\', \"Phweeew, that was really long and complicated, sorry for that.

Chemically speaking, it is a bee-derived, supersaturated sugar solution.\\\\xa0 About\\\\xa095%\\\\xa0of\\\\xa0honey\\\\xa0dry weight is sugar and the other 5% consists of a great number of other minor components including proteins, amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, and minerals.', 'This unique and complex chemical composition gives honey a bunch of nice skin care properties: it is very moisturizing, has soothing and antioxidant abilities as well as significant antibacterial and antifungal magic powers. There is also a lot of empirical evidence with emerging scientific backup that honey dressing promotes the healing of wounds and burns.', 'One tricky thing about honey though, is that it can have lots of different floral sources and different types of\\\\xa0honey\\\\xa0have a somewhat different composition and thus somewhat different properties. For example,\\\\xa0the darker the honey the richer it is in antioxidant phenolic compounds.\\\\xa0 Two special types of honey are\\\\xa0acacia and manuka. The former\\\\xa0is unique and popular because of its higher than usual fructose content that makes it more water-soluble and easier to stabilize in\\\\xa0cosmetic formulas. The latter comes from the Leptospermum Scoparium tree native to New Zeland and its special thing is its extra strong antibacterial power due to a unique component called methylglyoxal.', 'Overall, honey is a real skin-goodie in pretty much every shape and form, and it is a nice one to spot on the ingredient list.']\"],\n",
